 POLITICS_CHOKWE_ANTAR_LAMUMBA_DESC:0 "While he may be the son of the first vice-president of the Republic of New Afrika in 1968, Chokwe Antar Lamumba is far better known for his successful career as the mayor of Mississippi's largest city and state capital, Jackson of which approximately 80% it's population is African American. Inheriting the Africanized name his father took decades earlier, Lamumba is a Pan-Africanist who has experience as a progressive in the Democratic Party. It is up for Lamumba to choose whether he will work with the Biden Regime and maintain a democracy or will he lead the African people of North America on a new journey of self determination with dignity, liberty, justice, and independence as his namesake attempted to do for the Congolese people sixty years ago."

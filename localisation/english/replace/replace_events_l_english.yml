 generic.27.d:0 "An person of interest has recently been brought to the CIA's knowledge, one 'Lord' Miles Routledge, an English citizen who considers himself an "Independent War Journalist" but who infact seems to be nothing more than a self-centred tourist.\n\nHe made his presence known during the fall of Afghanistan earlier this year, and it seems his next stop is our own beloved United States.\n\nOur intelligence was initially concerned about his possible ties to the far-right, and that he could be a spy, but after further investigation he seems to just be goofing around."

 utah.1.t:0 "Volunteers Arrive"
 utah.1.d:0 "At exactly 4 in the afternoon, a small caravan of 12 black suvs approached the state capitol building. Exiting those vans were men wearing black military uniforms carrying machine guns and explosives. They did not come to overthrow the government, rather they are here to assist it. Inside they met with Deseret state officials and army commanders to debrief them and welcome them. These men are elite mormon fighters from Mexico, who have come here to volunteer to fight for the state in exchange for permanent residency. After the presentation they dispersed from the buildings and drove to the barracks to be integrated with the National Guard the following morning."
 utah.1.a:0 "Welcome, Brothers."
 utah.2.t:0 "The Utah National Guard Deposes The Mormons"
 utah.2.d:0 "The Utah National Guard was trained to do anything and everything to defend and help their state. While this state's sole existence is because of Mormons, their influence in politics is extremely dangerous and by order of the state is to be removed. National Guard units have been sent in to take over every church and building owned by the Church of LDS. Like the trained soldiers they are, they seized control of Salt Lake Temple and arrested every higher up member including church officials. This state and country were founded upon the ideals of a separation between church and state, sometimes the state needs to remind the church of this by force."
 utah.2.a:0 "Down with the Mormons!"
 utah.3.t:0 "Mitt Romney Is Elected"
 utah.3.d:0 "Mitt Romney, the main leader of the Rino movement in the Utah Republican party has won the election. Known for his defeat in 2012 against Obama and his outspoken criticism against Trump, Romney was now the President-Elect of the Utah nation. Mitt Romney is a safe choice for the state as he himself a devout Mormon can help heal the broken relations between the government and the Church of LDS. Mitt Romeny walked onto the stage wearing a black suit, a red tie and donned a Romney 2012 baseball cap. He took his hat off which he handed to his wife as his family stood with him on the podium. Many in Utah attended his inauguration but many more chose to watch from home. The state was not overly thrilled to see him win. Anti-Mormon forces saw him as being easily swayed by the Mormons they fought to get out of power. Meanwhile the Church of LDS and devout Mormons see him as a traitor to the faith. Mitt Romney has big shoes to fill for his state but he is up for the challenge. If he was able to be a Republican Governor in a hard blue state like Massachusetts, then he could be a Republican President in a state where half the population hates his gut."
 utah.3.a:0 "Congratulations Mitt!"
 utah.4.t:0 "Brian King Is Elected"
 utah.4.d:0 "Being a democrat in a hard red state, Brian King felt like a sheep surrounded by wolves. There was little he could get done, but that all changed when the civil war came to Utah's borders. Seeing the destructive nature of the Republican party, Utahans voted blue for the first time in a while seeing King come out victorious. For the first time since  1964, the state has gone blue. It is now up to Brian King and his incoming administration to keep it that way." Brian King was sworn in at the Utah State Capitol building on a dark and gloomy day. There were no crowds for him outside to protest or cheer as it was simply too wet or too cold for anyone to care. His supporters were inside the capitol cheering him on as he took his oath of office. To everyone else it was simply because of the rain, but to Brian it was awfully symbolic. He always dealt with his small crowds of support and would be surrounded by the rain of his adversaries across the aisle. But this time, he was the one in control, and the rain which kept him down was outside. As he concluded his speech, he looked out into the audience to give one final line... "Here's to Utah, Here's to Democracy!", Brian yelled out. He received a standing ovation as he went to kiss his wife and hug his family. Brian had done it, and now it is time to get to work."
 utah.4.a:0 "A Voice for all Utahans!"
 utah.5.t:0 "Gay Benninion Is Elected"
 utah.5.d:0 "For the second time in Utah's history, a female candidate successfully won an election to become head of state. This time is different as it is Utah's first female president as opposed to Utah's first female governor. Gay Bennion came from a christian, military family and through the democratic party fought for environmental regulations and education in a hard red state. Now that she is in office, some of her plans for issues can now finally be realized.Gay Bennion was sworn in by Utah's only female state Supreme Court Justice, Paige Peterson. It was moving to both the state and the audience as the newly elected President and the Justice swearing her in were some of the states only female representatives. Despite their political differences, Gay Bennion insisted on having her be swoen in by her, which Paige graciously accepted. She concluded her inauguration speech by speaking to the women of Utah by telling them they could do anything if they worked hard enough. Women cheered, Men rolled their eyes and Utah now had a new female president." 
 utah.5.a:0 "Congratulations Bennion!"
 utah.6.t:0 "Former Governor Cox Is Elected"
 utah.6.d:0 "Former and Popular Governor Spencer Cox has been re-elected as the into a position of power in Utah. He was most notable for his handling of the pandemic as well as his role in the nation building of Utah. Many on both sides see him as the George Washington of the new Utah, willing to work with both sides of the aisle to create a strong and free state. Spencer was nervous, while he had been through inaugurations before, to be inaugurated as the first president of your state is something that he did not think he would ever experience. With his family behind him, he took a deep breath before walking out into BYU's football field. The crowd had filled the stadium to the brim and had gone nuts to see him and his family walk up to the podium. Many Utahans were hopeful after seeing the inauguration, and if they kept the same energy they did today this new administration could do anything."
 utah.6.a:0 "Congratulations"
 utah.7.t:0 "Allen Glines Elected"
 utah.7.d:0 "Allen Glines, a Democrat, has been elected to the presidency of the state of Utah. Glines is a community activist and through a tremendous grass roots campaign won the hearts of every Utahn from Garden City to Big Water. Many are excited to see what a true "man of the people" is ready to do. Allen Glines met with a crowd of his supporters at a local elementary school. He was sworn in and gave a speech about the power of people. He thanked each and every member of his staff personally before thanking the community as a whole. He emphasized that every single person who voted for him, campaigned for him, polled for him or even just suggested his name to a voting friend had helped Utah. He then showed bipartisanship and commended the campaigns of his fellow candidates before closing saying he cannot wait to work with them and everyone."
 utah.7.a:0 "Congratulations Allen!"
 utah.8.t:0 "Mike Lee Elected"
 utah.8.d:0 "Mike Lee was many things from a senator, a conservative, a Christian, a father, a husband and now he was Utah's next President. Mike Lee was very conservative but equally charismatic, beating out all of the opponents in his primary by decrying them as being too liberal and weak. For every ounce of conservatism he has he holds an equal amount of compassion and confidence. Many outside sources have said that because of his policies and beliefs that Utah simply has elected their own Donald Trump but only time will tell. In order to heal ties with the Mormons as well as look good in the eyes of his Christian base, Mike Lee chose time to be inaugurated at the Temple of Salt Lake City. The President of the church walked out and he was sworn in under the Book of Mormon to a small crowd of modestly dressed supporters. Many critics have called this event "pissing in the face of separation of church and state", but Mike could care less about those hecklers as they weren't even inside to yell at him. As he concluded his speech, the crowd stood up for a standing ovation before the Mormon Tabernacle choir had begun to sing a rendition of Oh come all ye faithful."

He and every other CTO in the state had orders to raid select buildings in areas considered to be controlled by Arizonian, Nevadan and Coloradan separatists. Raids would be carried out every night, in every part of the state and would end up in gunfights and arrests. Most of the time it would lead to separatists getting killed or arrested, only to make headlines on the news to boost the morale of people to native Utahans and lower it for everyone else. But there are other times where the separatists end up winning the gunfights and escaping the scene. That is at least what happened in one of the first raids held in Arizona. The news line after the following day talked about how there were 5 dead and 11 injured National Guard who took part in a raid in Arizona. The news put out a moment of silence for the men killed including John Dewalt, Hugh Bernstein, Samuel Clarkson, Peter Collins and Mark Houston."

Not every single separatist is a bloodthirsty separatist, they are just misguided people fighting for what they believe is their land.

Rees' words silenced that committee member. Another member hesitantly spoke up about various significant families within Oregon and Washington who can trace their lineage back to old English--\n\n"But are any of them the sort of stock we want on our noble crown?" The room fell silent."I thought not." Rees stood, and walked to the window overlooking Portland. Is there truly nobody fit for the task? Is my committee staffed with fools? He suddenly heard a young member pipe up before being silenced by his colleagues. Rees turned around."You there. What do you have for me?"\n\nThe Young man trembled slightly, as he watched the look of utter disdain across his comrades. After a brief moment, he uttered out, "Well, sir, there is one man.

He wasn't the biggest fan of being under the thumb of the Japs, but they were embarking on a renewed Imperial Army program and their geographical relation to Cascadia was more than obvious.

Or was it Prussians? Something like that. Whatever. None of that mattered. What mattered was the task ahead.\n\nRees had never been one for civilian affairs, so he enacted a sort of Laissez-Faire style of management. Other than dealing with the Army, he would sit in his office in Portland, and allow the needy to petition him for various efforts. To be honest, he didn't care much at all.

Initially meant to be a relatively uneventful easy win for the Liberals, MacArthur's return and Blitz Campaign strategy totally upset the numbers, turning it into anyone's gain. MacArthur has achieved a great deal of popularity in such a short period of time, but will it be enough to snatch victory from the jaws of defeat? The Liberals are also concerned about the new electoral behemoth, and their otherwise easy victory was smashed completely. The Tories, too, saw their opportunity to swoop into power off the broken backs of a tired Whig and Liberal Party. Of course, the Greens are not completely counted out yet either, although many fear the best they could do is split the progressive vote and hand power to the Tories or the Whigs. But who shall ultimately come out on top?"

At the head of the Chinese delegation, there was silence, eagerly waiting to hear the report from Sanders, previously asking him to fulfill the obligations he gave them, within which he had a set deadline to ensure Maoism had a place in the New America. Sanders knew that the Chinese would be angry with his moves to Democratize the country after all the support and U.N. Shit they went through to help him against the Fleet. When he told them his plans for Democratization, the room fell silent. Dissatisfied with the work that this administration was doing, very unsuccessfully, the delegate demanded something that both sides knew could never be fulfilled, impossible both during unity and during the rapid spreading of dissent. Sanders tried everything to make the Chinese delegation come to its senses, but they did not want to give up their idea and intention to repay all the debts invested in this Sanders project. The meeting lasted in full swing for the next hour, full of tensions over agreements, new promises, old lies, and nothing new except the look of eyes that were supposed to persuade the Chinese delegation to deviate from debt collection. Everything was in vain. In the end, the Chinese decided to slap the Sanders administration, knowing that they had no money to pay off the debts, saying the following: ''For good intentions and good service to remain as it is now, we will have to approach the collection of your debts by different methods. We demand the following service from you - we want our government's full right and complete control over the ports of San Francisco.'' "

An incompetent government brought occupation to American soil for the first time after 200 years of our independence and invincibility! To ensure what God and the nation have given us, we must do what is hardest in our hearts, we will have to tear our state, even more, to save it because it is better to die poor and hungry than under the steel boots of a communist dictator! I am now speaking to you as a representative of the nation, as one of you, ready to fight for the independence of the Arizona Culture, to do my best, to do what is left of us after the great destruction of American society.

On top of this, the Imperial Wizard Council of Dixie has officially petitioned for full annexation into the Reich." \n\nMiller leaned back in his chair.\n\n"The part that shocked me the most is the international recognition we have received, we are already beginning to set up embassies across Europe and many countries are more than willing to trade with us.

"We are here to mourn the death of Eric Trump, a man whose life was stolen from us too soon, and may those who brought his death upon him face God's wrath for their sins," the priest began, before talking about how Eric stood as an icon for the people of Florida and their hopes and dreams, and how they should go on and not tarnish his memory.\n\nBarron began thinking back to the moment his brother's life was taken from him, remembering the sudden chaos as the figure burst into the room, levelling a handgun at Eric. Before anyone could even comprehend what was happening, the shots, oh God the shots rang out and in that moment Eric became no more than an empty body.\n\n"Now, Barron Trump," the priest said, jolting him out of his bleak memories into an only slightly less bleak moment. "Do you want to say anything about your brother?" He gestured for him to come up to the platform where the priest and the coffin were.\n\nBarron nodded, coming up the steps and trying not to stare at the well-crafted coffin, the best that money could buy. If only there was a way to buy Eric's return. He turned to face the crowd, his face morose and still. His eyes caught on Jeb, who was murmuring quietly to a few other men next to him in the crowd, pausing slightly as he noticed Barron's gaze, before continuing the conversation, too quiet for him to make out what they were saying.\n\n"My brother may not have been perfect," he started his speech, his mind immediately coming up with several mistakes he had made as he led Florida. "But he did the best he could, especially in the chaotic times we live in. I'm sure nobody here is glad he is gone-" Did he hear a snicker? Or was he just being paranoid? "But we cannot change what happened to him. We can only carry on and hope we can do what is best for us and all of our people." He bowed his head to look at his black, polished shoes, making sure to squash his emotions. How could he seem like a capable leader if he started bawling his eyes out?\n\nA few claps came from assorted people in the crowd, quiet to try and not disturb the mood of the occasion as Barron moved down from the platform where his brother lay, glad to have that over with. He had a lot to do, and he didn't know how much longer he had to do it all."

I know you want to believe in our troop's willpower, but for God's sake they'll get slaughtered even more than they would in a World War 1 battle!"\n\n"So just shoving guns into civilian's hands right after you draft them? Yeah that'll work," Rafael scoffed, turning his back on his fellow general.\n\n"Our people have been hardened by these conflicts, don't be so disheartened by the thought.

Bastard careerists had become greedy and politicised in the wake of the civil war. None of them cared about Florida, none of them cared about America. They just sat here, in Miami, filling their pockets and speaking out against their supposed Commander-In-Chief.\n\nThis was the worst post of them all. Instead of doing any good, fighting Confederates or Commies, he was making sure these officers didn't get some rocks thrown at them by frustrated schoolchildren. Well, at least the current government was making moves against them. That was something at least. Rico thought about his disappointment in Jeb, however. He couldn't believe he voted for that worm into the governorship all those years ago. Although these days, voting seemed like a distant memory.\n\nThe Officer finally reached Rico, and interrupted his thoughts. "You there, Corporal. Where do your loyalties lie in this civil war?" Rico snorted. He hated these types of people. His loyalty is being questioned, undoubtedly by a man whose loyalties were to the rebellious Governor and not to the rightful Leader. He'd show him.\n\n"With Florida, of course... Sir." The Officer looked disappointed in him. Good. Showed that bastard that not everyone supports rich idiots in glass castles. What was he gonna do about it? Report me?\n\n"Very Well." The officer said to Rico's surprise. And before Rico could react, the Officer raised his M1911 to his head."

He could not open his eyes nor could he think normally from the torture he suffered. Every step would upset him to flinch in fear thinking that Judgment Day had come for him. Spreading through the cells, the sound of the creaking of a metal door woke him from the sleep he so desperately wanted to get. Hitting the wall and the bars with his fingers, Jeb knew who was coming to visit him again. He turned to his side to see what he had to see every third day of the week. Barron ran his hand over the fence that separated him from Jeb, who said with suffering in his voice, "Not you ... not you again, you motherfucker ..."\n\n"Open the door." Barron told the guard, who turned the keys in search of the right one. After the door is opened, Jeb tried to escape towards the wall, visibly frightened and distraught by Barron's appearance. "Get on your feet, you useless bag of fleas!" He yelled at him, kicking him in the stomach and grabbing him by the collar. Jeb only succumbed to this silence and did not intend, nor did he have the strength to get up. Knowing that Jeb would not get up, he pulled him towards him and threw him to the ground, now even harder than he had kicked him the first time. "I don't have time to lose, get up!" He yelled at him until Jeb intended to give up his helpless lying on the cold concrete as Barron screamed his name, demanding he not be a poor coward. "If you could get away with it and declare war, take this as a continuation of the war!" He yelled again, kicking him directly in the spine, while Jeb moaned with all his might, begging for mercy. "There is no mercy for the traitors of the regime!" He continued, not giving in. Jeb tried to lift himself against the wall with his hand, but Barron prevented him from doing so by stepping on his hand with a heavy military boot, breaking his bones into small pieces. Jeb no longer had the strength, he had to surrender, and this was no longer interesting to Barron either, and he realized that his torture would lose its sharpness if he continued. Approaching him in a light, quiet, threatening tone, he told him: ''Now you won't be able to clap, Bush's shit ...''"

"It's gonna be okay," the person murmured, trying to quiet the child so he didn't agitate the police more. "Do you know where your father is?" he asked.\n\nThe kid shook his head slightly, started to choke down his tears so he wouldn't make as much noise. "Got... giraffed into da war," he said quietly, still reaching out to his mother and trying to go towards her as she was roughly dragged into the armored truck, before driving off.

This doesn't happen every day." Turning in the opposite direction. "I could be Barron's guy for stuff ... yes, that would be really something. Being his man. Top man. I'm just going to have to work hard for this." He continued to talk to himself as he walked down the hall. "Washington is for pussies. I'm gonna be like Stonewall Jackson.

The professor emphasized, sitting at his desk and looking at the students who were unquestioningly listening to what was being given to them and how they were still fed with lies from the tablecloth. "The best example of this was Thomas Jefferson. He did not want to use his position to remove the idea of ​​slavery, although he had the possibilities and space for such maneuvering, but his basic idea, which he implemented in 1802 with the White Act, remained hidden behind the scenes. neoliberal American policy which made it clear that slavery was universal in the sense that it represented more white people as slaves than blacks, leading us to the new conclusion that the post-Washington administration had a very clear intention to subjugate not only blacks but all races, which is one of the provisions of the White Act of 1802 that we have already mentioned. Slavery is not determined by race. Slavery is determined by human decisions that lead to bad or criminal acts. " These were the last words of the teacher who closed the book while showing a copy of the 'White Act of 1802' signed by Thomas Jefferson.

It arrived at lunchtime and today on offer was moldy bread with one small glass of water from a local swamp they were pumping so that the water could go to unspoiled citizens in Miami and larger cities like Savannah. Throwing those pieces of bread with a shovel like pigs, people started fighting, knowing that if they failed to catch food, they would stay hungry for today. Whoever stays hungry will slack off.

In another step to legitimize his rule, it appears that he is seeking reorganization and a military alliance from our administration. If I had to speculate, I would assume he is seeking recognition from another minor power, at least in the eyes of the global community, to build upward toward full global recognition in the coming years. While he may view us as less powerful, we could easily use the same logic to our advantage. We too, could use this alliance to build upwards to a globally respected position. Of course, this decision will come down to you, and you only, what is your decision?\n\nThe board took a moment to consider the proposal. “What exactly would be required of this company if we were inclined to accept this proposal?”\n\nTarrio ordered one of his aides to pass out informational documents that outlined the order under which this alliance would exist. “Simply put, this is an offensive and defensive military alliance. The Confederacy hopes that Corporate West Virginia will join us along with the Colonel to establish unity in our region. The combined might of our armies would allow our three nations to be independent from any foreign influence. This pact would further allow our three nations to tie our economies together, strengthening our power not only militarily, but economically too. Finally, we have worked together well, and our regions have become far more stable due to cooperation. With that said, we will respect any decision the board comes to.

 montana.1.t:0 "The Last Election"
 montana.1.d:0 "It's been a while since Montana lost contact with the central government. Following the Constitution, USA presidency was meant to give instructions, but instead there was a gibberish exchange of views on both sides of the rival parties. For the first time in history - and let's hope last, Montana have been forgotten. The time moves forward though, and while Stephen Bullock is in power, we need an emergency plan. Both Biden and Trump count on our cooperation. \n\nThe first step of our "new government" should be to determine whether or not we are to continue to be bound by the old constitution - by calling new elections, following Biden or Trump. On the other hand, since the legal US government ceased to exist, we could declare independence by appointing our governor as the permanent country's warden."
 montana.1.a:0 "We will stay loyal to The US Constitution!"
 montana.1.b:0 "To independence, we rise!"

As your governor, I declare my readiness to defend our own ideals, our land, and our new-old homeland - MONTANA! We are ready to create a country without conflicts, a country under my leadership. Who is with me? Who is with Montana?'' \n\nLoud applause from all sides of the room could be heard even during the television broadcast. Montanan government, which has so far been trying to find itself in the civil war, had finally proclaimed independence, rejecting offers of the divided central government. Both Trump and Joe Biden commented this move as ''insignificant and pathetic''."

 montana.3.t:0 "Montanan Military Offers Support"
 montana.3.d:0 "Seeing the changes and the attempts to take over the national guard by the governor's forces, the army offered to help transform the state. All they need to "be loyal and ready to sacrifice their lives for the New Montana" is an increased military funding. So far, this is a friendly form of request, in exchange for the big military support. \n\nWe might have no more occasion like this. Rerouting some of our funds to the army could help us with eventual independence, maintaining regional power, and most importantly - convince the political right wing to us. On the other hand, we shouldn't be too soft as it may turn our state to one of the African model corrupted dictatorships."

 montana.4.t:0 "Military Returns the Favor"
 montana.4.d:0 "With a smile of his face, our field marshal came to give his report. It seems our army has found a secret group of underground republicans working for Trump.

Thanks to our motivated and well-financed staff, we managed to arrest all members responsible for the implementation of the plan. Montana is safe, and the other Republicans seem to be unquestionably backing our actions now."
 montana.4.a:0 "We are truly proud of our army!"
 montana.5.t:0 "Army Defected!"

 montana.6.d:0 "Following the declaration of independence, the plan of our more ''dictatorial'' government came under criticism from those who had previously supported us. Although still most of our voters support [MON.GetLeader], it seems they do not like how the law is right now only a will of his. \n\nThere are not many things we can do, but we can try to please them by modelling our law to be more transparent, just and stable, or by getting rid of them, showing them ''our power projection''."

 montana.8.t:0 "The Great Migration"
 montana.8.d:0 "Though the protests have stopped following our military intervention, it seems that cities and larger regions are deserted.

 montana.9.t:0 "Canada at war!"
 montana.9.d:0 "At a completely unexpected moment, the authorities of independent Montana declared a state of war with Canada, accusing it of violating their country's sovereignty. This is most likely related to the "Great Migration crisis", in which Canadians agreed to grant asylum to repressed Montana residents. \n\nCanadian authorities call for an immediate cessation of fire, requesting UN crisis summit on immediate intervention in the escalating, dangerous conflict in Northern America."

 montana.10.t:0 "Montana Wants to Establish Trade Routes"
 montana.10.d:0 "The government of independent Montana turned to us with a request to open new trade routes through our country. This is probably related to the difficult situation in the US. \n\n While other factionsa fighting over US may condemn this action, separate trade treaties with Montana could fuel our economy, which is lacking resources. We lost our former trade routes since the collapse of the USA, and this might be a good opportunity to restore the trade at least partially."

 montana.11.a:0 "Reasonable and good"
 montana.12.t:0 "Canada Rejects Our Proposal"
 montana.12.d:0 "After longer than expected time, we received correspondence in which the Canadian authorities decided to refuse to open the borders. The main reason for this decision was Canada's willingness to remain neutral in the face of the conflict taking place in America. \n\nOur diplomats assume the real reason may be a reluctance to support Montana due to the likely consequences from larger factions fighting over USA."
 montana.12.a:0 "Shame on them"
 montana.13.t:0 "Intervention in Cascadia"
 montana.13.d:0 "The situation in Cascadia is, to put it mildly - tense. The disorganized temporary staff of generals clearly needs help, and is willing to sacrifice a great deal to end the rebellion against the socialist ideals of the south. Sanderists are on the other side of the barricade, restlessly fighting for the coast. Both sides seem to have equal chances of winning. \n\nWe have many options. On the tactical side, it would be good and deadly to invade and then split Cascadia between us and the Sanderists. However, guided by political motives, we should support Cascadia, or even try to take control over it - if only they agree to our rule. They are desperate enough to not deny."

 montana.14.a:0 "Excellent news"
 montana.15.t:0 "Montana Sends Volunteers"
 montana.15.d:0 "The authorities of the neighboring state of Montana have decided to help us in the fight against Sanderism developing in America by sending some of their men willing to aid us in fight.

 montana.15.a:0 "It's good to have such neighbor"
 montana.16.t:0 "Montana Offers ''Protection''"
 montana.16.d:0 "The Montana authorities have contacted us about our war. Unfortunately, there was a strange aggression in their tone. These authorities wish to cooperate in return for an offer to protect our state from the sanderists, and to preserve our autonomy by partially taking power over our military staff. In practice, this means that they would like to take over our rebellion using its opportunity to expand - not to help us. \n\nGiving them control over our army will de facto lead to our annexation, and it seems they are military preparing for us to decline the offer just to seize us, by force."

 montana.16.b:0 "We are not falling for this!"
 montana.17.t:0 "Cascadia Accepts Our Lead"
 montana.17.d:0 "The Cascadian forces expressed their support for our protection, that is, our political leadership.

 montana.17.a:0 "They will rejoice soon"
 montana.18.t:0 "Cascadia Resists"

 montana.22.d:0 "The staff of the Cascadian generals agreed to accept our soldiers into their ranks.

It is a process that should be properly directed to allow it to produce appropriate results in the future. \n\nWe need to choose between financing rural hospitals, or those in urban areas. The choice is hard, as both countrymen and city inhabitants are important to us. Investment in city healthcare would allow the rest of our heath institutions to focus on science, while helping countrymen would give us some support of theirs, and definitely more of saved manpower."

 montana.29.d:0 "Some, wondering about the future of an independent Montana, were unsure of its direction. Ultimately, it turned out that the game to achieve independence was more of an attempt to disguise his allegiance to Trump's forces. Following today's secret leadership meeting, an alliance was formally forged to include Montana in the ever-expanding Loyalists' front. \n\n Trump sees this as a great step towards the unification of America's interests, while [MON.GetLeader] sees it as a great opportunity for expansion and ''restoration'' of the Northwest Territorial Imperative."

There were two active factions within the fleet, the Army and the Militia. The Army was composed mostly of former US Marines and were the bulk of the land forces responsible for taking down Sanders. On one hand they were extremely organized and loyal but on the other they are not very popular amongst the newly conquered Californians. The Militia is a loose term given to the various freedom fighter groups that fought alongside the Army against the regime. They were responsible for sabotage, espionage, assassination and were crucial in urban conflicts. While they lack any proper discipline or training they are seen in more of a favorable light than that of the Army. One of these factions needs to be followed in order to end this power struggle in the fleet.

Consider this Commander Matthews, a strong state, a strong and patriotic state. One that didn't bow down to Liberals in New York or Conservatives in Oklahoma. A state where decisions weren't made by a whiny orange bastard or a elderly decrepit fool. There would be no contestation against this new state as it worked for everyone as much as everyone worked for it. There would be no two party bullshit, the only shit that would matter is keeping the lights on and the people happy. This is what I would like to see in a new America. Not one where people burn the American flag or replace it with one of political demagoguery.... But one where they stand and salute... or else. It would not be a failed union of states or a petty republic, no. It would, be one, unitary state.

As he walked out to the balcony he saw in his court yard roughly 30 or so men, armed and wearing balaclavas. When they saw him they got into some kind of formation and offered a salute to him. Taken back and confused, he put down his coffee and gave a salute back.\nLike what you see Admiral Aquilino, this is one of the more finer militia divisions we have, '' one of his Captains said as he looked up to him.

After the Canadian representative joined and spoke briefly, the Admiral had begun to ask his question.\nIt's no secret, the fleet is in desperate need for their supplies. I will not lie to you my friend the issue of where to get the supplies has become a debate within the fleet. The European Union wanted nothing to do with the fleet, there was no recognition with the UN and there was no way in hell we were taking supplies from those bastards in Moscow or Beijing.

His latest book was about the Russian Civil War and about the various factions during it. He would often take comparisons between the book and the state of the fallen states as a fun game. There was one character in his book that did catch his eye as he saw him as quite comparable to himself. His name was Alexander Kolchak, a naval Admiral from the far east who ruled his warlord state as a Supreme Leader. What Admiral Aquillino was confused about was the book was making him out to seem like a bad guy, but after thinking more about him he began to empathize with his situation in the book. He then finished the chapter he was on as he walked up to his mirror to take a look at himself. He envisioned himself wearing a bright white uniform adorned with medals and awards. He imagined a bright white Admiral's hat with the crest of his fleet and various national symbols. He thought of having a decortational saber on his hip, dress pants and the nicest black dress shoes money could buy. And then he thought to himself the title of Supreme Leader..... Supreme Leader Aquillino.\n\nMaybe I'm the American Kolchak... the Admiral muttered to himself."

Perhaps the most intriguing thing about these policies was the new round of propaganda posters.

The Admiral made a great retreat into Northern Alaska in order to evade the new Alaskan government. Using some funds he had “acquired” from what was left of the fleet’s economy he purchased a small cabin in the wilderness under a fake name. Aquilino simply expected to live out the rest of his life as a hermit, reading books about old naval battles and keeping warm by the fire with a bottle of brandy. Aquilino sat by his fire with his drink, as he had been doing for a few weeks now. He let his beard grow long as he had simply docked all his cares in the harbors of his former ships. His quiet time was interrupted by the sound of a siren and a megaphone.\n\n"John C. Aquilino you're under arrest, please exit the cabin and approach us with your hands up!" cried out the voice.\n\nAquilino was a man who would always search for the best tactic available, but a rusty old pistol he had from the navy would be no match for the dozens of police outside already taking aim. He decided that it would not be worth running anymore, and all he hoped was that history would not remember him as a traitor or a tyrant, but a man who did what he needed to do. He did make one decision that if he were to go down, he would go down dressed in his finest. He put on that famous uniform he wore what felt like many years ago, he combed his hair, shaved and decided to leave his parade saber as a show of no hostilities.\n\n"Mr. Aquilino if you do not exit the cabin in five minutes we will be forced to breach, please cooperate now and avoid any further escalation!" the voice cried out again.\n\nHe inspected himself in the mirror, liking what he saw but wishing that he would wear this uniform parading the streets of California and not the snowy tundra of Alaska.

And then people started pouring in. Maybe it was the wikipedia articles, maybe it was the silly film he had taken part in, but people wanted refuge, and what could Kevin Baugh do but oblige? More people showed up. Some with tents, some with only the clothes on their backs, and some with even less. Defectors from the world over, not Republican, not Democrat, but American. Baugh welcomed them with blankets and open arms. His Vice President and wife had been a godsend in this time as well, for every person that came in she came in, asking names, if they needed help, or even just a phone call. Most were happy to find peace, maybe for a few days, maybe a month, even. But as the tensions rose, more people found themselves staying. Kevin Baugh found himself with real legitimacy, and when he had asked for more land, more help, the neighboring cities, floundering in their own right, joined in. They turned a ghost town into a real settlement, and A town of four hundred into four thousand. Change was coming to the Republic of Molossia. Baugh only hoped he could meet it with a steady hand."

Ideas ran through his head. He considered just leaving the system in place, just to see what would happen. But this wasn't a nation of test subjects, it was a nation of people, and something needed to be done. His eyes settled on a map on his wall, listing out the nearby settlements.

As tax collectors from Deseret enter the unrecognized country of Molossia, they realize this with a harsh and unforgiving sense. At this time, Deseret is fighting a war for their survival, and need everything they can get to kick start their war machine. For them, Molossia was nothing more than part of the Deseret nation, and needed to pay their taxes and serve their nation in arms to protect their nation against the "aggressors" of the forces under Kaczynski. Yet, Molossia was a very independent state, and wished for it to be so. So, when tax collectors (followed by soldiers) came into their lands and demanded things that weren't theirs to take, the Molossians grew furious. As the disagreements in the streets turned to slaps and punches, it was only a matter of time before violence hit the two nations in their first battle."

Of course, a reaction like this would not go unnoticed, and by the next day the Molossian military had entered the town the Deseretians were still in and stood ready to fight a good fight. If one thing is clear on that day though, Americans are persistent mothertruckers, as the Deseretian soldiers also stood ready to fight for their divine nation under God. \n\nHours passed, and soon it was a hot and grueling 2pm. One very very unlucky Molossian soul was just minding his own business, strolling through town to get some groceries from the nearby store, when he stumbled across the place where the Deseret troops and tax collectors stood. By this point, the foreign tax collectors were so done with the bullshit that was that day, and demanded that the man pay his taxes on the spot. Of course, the Molossian said that he was not a Deseretian, and even if he was, did not have enough money to pay what was asked. The Molossian troops watched carefully as the situation unfolded.\n\nFor the tax collectors and soldiers, this man saying that he would not pay his taxes pissed them off more than anything in the world. So, when one of the Deseretian soldiers aimed his rifle at the poor citizen of this unrecognized country, it was a disaster. The bullet peirced the head of the Molossian... blood poured out of his head as he hit the ground hard. If there is one thing you never do...you never fire the first shot. The Molossian troops who saw it unfold immediately fired at the Deseretian soldiers as battle raged. By 4pm, whatever remained of the tax collecting force fled the town back to their borders. The town cheered as they ran... but what was to come would be even more pain that what could have ever happened on that day."

The light border defense force was swiftly dealt with due unpreparedness for the overwhelming surprise attack, and stark red blood stained the sand. A fallback line has begun to form as Molossian troops dig trenches and build artillery embankments. There was no formal declaration of war because not only do old world measures of civility no longer serve a purpose in the deserts of shattered America, but also because Deseret passionately refuses to recognize the sovereignty of Molossia. To them, they are just cleaning the trash out of their backyard. Reports of the invasion moved up the small chain of command, eventually reaching President Baugh. He stood in a room deep inside the command bunker at the center of Molossia.

The ambassador was a shabby man with long matted and tangled brown hair and a full wild beard. His face was a red tan and covered in sand and grime from the desert air. He had terrible posture and wore a mangled and tattered suit shoddily patched with animal furs. \n\n\"Hello President Baugh sir\", he said with twisted mouth and foul breath. \"I come here as a representative of the Liberated Regions of Primitiva and Theodore Kaczynski.\" The man spoke in a wild voice and with a thick accent whose origin was unknown to Baugh. \"What's your business with Molossia sir, you are aware we are currently fighting for our lives, aren't you?\" said Baugh begrudgingly.\n\n\"That is exactly the purpose of my visit. The people of Primitiva and our way of life are also under attack by the modernist scum of Deseret. I am here to offer your nation an alliance of military cooperation and mutual assistance,\" replied the ambassador. \n\nBaugh was taken aback. He never imagined he would find himself on the same side as the man who bombed universities and airports. He was shocked that this man even had a nation of people under his command. But when the shock of the encounter subsided, Baugh knew he had to accept the offer. Deseret was to large for Molossia to defeat on its own and he was backed up against a wall. \"Fine,\" Baugh begrudgingly accepted, \"I think cooperation would be the best for both of us. My soldiers will escort you home and I will transmit the vital information to your command\". \n\n\"One more thing, sir\" the ambassador added. \"My commander will only accept written communications\"."

Trump's America is no more, just as his vision and tyrrany. \n\nLots of Americans from Trump's States with less radical views thanked us for liberating their states from the occupation.

He had been summoned by President Mitch McConnell to the Oval Office, with an urgency in his voice Roosevelt had never heard before. Arriving at the door to the Oval Office, Roosevelt placed his hand on the cold doorknob, then hesitated. Something felt off. After a second of delay, Roosevelt opened the door, as lightning shook the windows and illuminated the shadowy figure in the dimly lit Oval Office. \n"Thank you for arriving on such short notice, I have an important matter to discuss with you."\n\nRoosevelt shut the door, and slowly walked towards the Resolute Desk where McConnell was standing, arms resting behind his back on the desk. \n"I've been in Washington for nearly forty years now. I have experienced the worst of party politics, inefficient bureaucracy. The system is broken. But I've decided I'm going to fix it. I'm going to merge the offices of the President, Vice President, and Senate President to eliminate any further obstructions to progress in our nation. The old system has failed, Ted, look where we are at today."\nMcConnell gestures to the wall, where a map of the various factions occupying the land where the former United States once stood is hung. Both stared at it silently for a moment, the rain picking up and whipped up against the windows and walls. Roosevelt turned towards McConnell, with confusion and fear edging into his mind.\n"What about democracy? The Constitution? Our republic?"\nMcConnell laughed. \n"You and I both know that those principles were thrown out the window long ago."\nMcConnell turned towards Roosevelt, any hint of laughter or lightheartedness gone and replaced with a cold gaze. \n"You can retire in Upstate New York, effective tomorrow. You can live out the rest of your life with your family, I'll make sure you are taken care of."\nRoosevelt sat there silent for what seemed like an eternity.\n\n"I won't let you do this." \n\nRoosevelt turned to walk out, but froze when he heard a click. He slowly turned back around, and his fears were confirmed. McConnell had a revolver in hand, pointed towards Roosevelt. \n"I'm sorry, Ted. I gave you a choice, I hoped you would have accepted. I like you... but not enough to let you get in the way."\n\nRoosevelt's mind raced. The rain outside intensified, with lightning striking every few seconds.

In the chaos of the aftermath, it was initially believed that the President had been shot, as his white shirt had been soaked with blood, and he was rushed to the hospital. Upon arrival, however, doctors discovered that the blood was not his, but one of his bodyguards, and that the President had avoided injury from the attack, aside from a sprained ankle from a bodyguard landing on him. The bodyguard who tackled the President to the ground unfortunately did not survive, as three of the four shots fired hit him in his chest, with the fourth lodging in the wall behind the President. In thanks to his fallen bodyguard, President West has ordered flags be flown at half staff across the nation. The President gave an address to the press on the steps of the hospital, promising that the person (or people) behind the attempt would be found quickly and prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law. Georgia Governor Brian Kemp and Proud Boys leader Enrique Tarrio have pledged the support of their respective apparatuses to this investigation."

Unfortunately for us, the attacker was able to escape in the chaos following the attempted assassination, and witness descriptions range from a young black woman to a geriatric white man. As part of this investigation, anyone traveling out of Atlanta by land or air will be required to submit to questioning regarding their whereabouts the last few days. Additionally, the government’s undercover agents in both the Klan and the Panthers are on high alert, looking for anything that may indicate involvement in the attempt. In parallel investigations, the Georgia Bureau of Investigation has begun a mass online dragnet, flagging any messages, posts, or other form of communication expressing sympathy for the shooter or hostility towards the President, while the Proud Boys have largely begun to replace the President’s bodyguards, as they were unable to prevent the attempted assassin from shooting in the first place. The public is in a panic, unaware of who the assassin was, what their goals are, and if any danger to themselves or the President remains."

Undercover personnel in the organization have reported that the Panthers’ leaders have been filled with rage since the attempt, insisting that if any of their members were responsible, they would turn them over to Enrique personally. Furthermore, all members of the Panthers that were brought in for questioning were found to have corroborated alibis, and were not responsible for the attacks. With this development, many in President West’s circle have urged him to crack down on the Klan, as the Panthers’ innocence surely means that the Klan was responsible. President West, however, has insisted that no action be taken until a definitive conclusion is reached in the investigation."

 south.45.d:0 "In a surprise turn of events, the Ku Klux Klan has been definitively cleared of any involvement in the attempt on President West’s life. After the Panthers were found to not be responsible earlier this month, most simply assumed that this must mean that the other radical mass-movement in the nation must be. However, President West’s intelligence director has informed him that after extensive questioning of Klan leader David Duke, as well as the information gleaned from agents implanted in the Klan, that the attacker was not linked to either major faction, and their identity remains a mystery. While any information about the investigation has not yet been released to the public, if they are informed that the government’s efforts were unable to find anything whatsoever, it will shake their confidence in the Confederacy. The best guess of the intelligence community at this time is that the attacker was either a lone wolf, or linked to a smaller and lesser known radical group. Even Governor Kemp’s GBI has struck out on leads, and President West is reportedly furious at this information, and has called for an immediate meeting with Governor Kemp and Enrique Tarrio, and the two can only hope that they will leave the meeting with their careers intact."

He had missed his family, and the simple pleasure of eating home cooked food at his own table was his own slice of heaven.\nThen the front door exploded.\n“ON THE GROUND! GET ON THE FUCKING GROUND!” A squad of armed men in all black burst through the door into the Dukes’ living room, and David, his wife, and his two children were frozen in shock. As one of the soldiers pointed his gun at David, he found the words to say that the government acquitted him and the Klan, they weren’t responsible, but the soldier didn’t respond. His wife and daughters were already on the ground, hands behind their backs, when David noticed that the soldiers armband bore not the stars and bars of the Confederate Army, but the white rooster of the Proud Boys. He stuttered in response to the soldier’s orders as he struggled to understand what this meant. The soldier grew tired of his lack of cooperation, and dragged him, kicking and screaming, along with his family, to their backyard. The four Dukes were made to stand, and unceremoniously shot in their yard.\nThis same story played across the Confederacy that night, with prominent opponents of President West disappearing, or, if they were lucky, being charged with conspiracy to murder a public official, and dragged off to a remote prison. The next morning, President West gave a press conference, flanked by Governor Kemp and Enrique Tarrio, announcing that the investigation had found both the Klan and the Panthers responsible for the attempt on his life, and that both organizations had officially been outlawed, with thousands of  members being arrested, or fleeing across the borders into Texas, Florida, or the Denver government. With these threats removed, nothing stands in the way of President West and his circle."

But now, with some semblance of political stability coming to Dixie, President West and his circle are faced with a decision as to what the future of the Confederacy should be.\nPresident West, for his part, supports a military and diplomatic offensive to reunite the rest of the former United States, with the South simply being the base of operations for the birth of a new America. He believes that America was once great and can be again, so long as it is unified under the structures of the Confederacy.\nGovernor Brian Kemp, on the other hand, believes that a campaign to reunite with the rest of the country would be doomed to fail. Pointing to the failure of General Lee’s campaign into Pennsylvania as the straw that doomed the first Confederacy, he advocates instead for a policy of maintaining the Confederacy’s borders, with possible expansion into other Southern states, as the rest of the country simply doesn’t have the values necessary to be contributing members of Confederate society.\nLastly, Enrique Tarrio advocates for a far different solution. In contrast to President West’s dreams of unification and Governor Kemp’s aspirations of an imperial Presidency, Tarrio believes that there is only one man who can possibly deliver the Confederacy, and, indeed, America into salvation: Donald Trump. Tarrio supports a partnership with the Denver government, with the end goal being the reabsorption of the Confederacy into Trump’s US.\nAfter hours of discussion, President West and his inner circle have come to a decision."

To rebuild not just the Confederacy, but all of America. To rebuild a better America, a Fairer America, one where black people and white people can work together. We can’t sit here and watch evil politicians and dictators kill their own people, we cannot stand for it. The people of the Confederacy must become the iron shield of protection and the sword of unification that America needs!”\nThat was a small part of the speech President West gave on the steps of the Executive Mansion in Atlanta today, following the news that Governor Kemp and Enrique Tarrio, previously the President’s two closest advisors, had been arrested in a plot to overthrow the President.

Because God never abandons His family, and we will never abandon our family, our great, American, family either! People, we are on a mission from God, to save God AND America!”\nOnlookers were caught slightly off guard today when President West’s speech on the direction of the Confederate economy evolved into a pronouncement that his new policy of American reclamation was not a plan devised of his own accord, but rather the result of a divine revelation."

As you may well know, President West stepped down out of fear for his family’s safety and his own health concerns, but this is a policy that he and I crafted together while he was still in office, and is the reason he chose me to succeed him. If we want the Confederacy to survive, it must remain that– A Confederacy. If we were to try to reunite America, the inevitable end result would be the destruction of our beloved Dixie, torn asunder by the tyrants Biden, Trump, and Sanders. Under my Presidency, we will ensure that the Confederacy will survive this collapse, and will grow to be a greater nation than the United States could ever be!”\nAs public outcry regarding the sudden retirement of President West reached a fever pitch, newly-inaugurated President Kemp gave a speech at the Confederate Obelisk at Oakland Cemetery in Atlanta, regarding what happened with his predecessor and what this meant for the Confederacy.

They would argue that giving the people any independence, no matter how fleeting, will only serve as a spark to galvanize them into rebellion, and we should instead push to integrate these territories as permanent parts of our state."

The Regent’s most devout followers have praised this as a step towards security for God’s Chosen People.

After the service, some members of the media attempted to question the pastors about the sprawling new mansions they acquired seemingly for free upon moving to the South, but they were convinced to go home by members of Jesus’s Eyes.

Thousands of men enlisted in Jesus’s Eyes after that sermon, with Jesus’s Eyes now being the second-largest government employer, only behind the regular military. Some anonymous sources inside the military have claimed that this will only lead to a decrease in organization, as the Jesus’s Eyes divisions will doubtless be less stringently trained than the regulars, but Regent West insists that these men will have “the wrath of God” within them, allowing them to fight far harder and longer than any mere man could ever hope to."

 south.81.d:0 "Today, an official proclamation was issued from the steps of the Capitol, officially declaring the end of the Confederacy as a nation, to be replaced immediately by the Republic of the Golden Circle. The Golden Circle will consist of all current territories of the Confederacy, including the recently-acquired territories in the Caribbean. The Golden Circle is a dream long-held by Southern expansionists since before the Civil War. While this new nation does not take the exact form as was envisioned by the Knights of the Golden Circle in 1854, the mere existence of it speaks to the longevity of an idea long dismissed by the general populace. The creation of a new nation signals that the former Confederate government does not intend to grant any form of independence to its newly-won territories. Reactions from foreign nations have ranged from uninterested to furious rage, but the now President of the Republic of the Golden Circle is hopeful for the future of his new nation, leading some to fear that even further expansion may be on the table."

 south.82.d:0 "Tarrio walked down the long halls of the capital building. Pictures of President Kanye now stood where many great Georgians once fiercely watched over, greater men than Kanye ever could be. The message from West Virginia had caused many sleepless nights, as many feared that chaos would soon spread South. The Confederacy was only held together by the sheer insanity of this one man, and Tarrio desperately needed to tame this insanity to keep the balance and stability for another day.\nHe walked into the President's room; Kanye was posing for his 20th portrait. Funny enough, this would be the 14th artist, as Kanye has ordered any artist who did not depict his perfection to be thrown into the South Georgia swamps. He turned towards Tarrio, and a crooked smile came across his face, “Minister T how you been, what’s the noise from the North?”\nTarrio stared deeply into this man, and spoke, “Sir, with all due respect, can you please put some proper clothes on, you’ve made the staff nervous walking around in a bathrobe these past weeks.”\nKanye walked towards his closet and threw on a sports jacket over his bathrobe, “Does this make you feel comfortable Mr. T, or does perfection still intimate you?”\nTarrio moved past the question and got to the matter at hand, “With the increase in civil wars, over the past few years, there is a growing worry that the West Virginian incident could spread to our great nation of Ye. We…you must consider sending troops to end this before it becomes a mess.”\nKanye took out his headphones “What was that again?” Tarrio almost screamed but Kanye cut him off, “I’m just kidding, I could read your lips. Either way, I don’t want to send my glorious fans to die for such a backwater region. Just look at the numbers T-100, West Virginia doesn’t buy enough of my albums for me to justify keeping them safe. Though if I guess spreading conflicts could cause more of my adoring disciples, and worse, it could cause me to delay my album again.” \nTarrio stepped back, realizing just how far-gone President Ye had become, but nothing could be done for now. There was only one final question to ask, “what are your orders, sir.”"

He took a bite out of a fresh KFC-certified biscuit before drinking some Southern sweet tea, finally, his eyes rested upon a letter that had been left on his desk. It was covered in crumbs but that was nothing a small hand wave couldn’t deal with.\nHe brushed off the envelope and cut it open. It was a letter from President Kanye, “To the Colonel, I hope these supplies find you well, and that you can deal with those rebels who have been slowing the production of your delicious chicken. Please, use these weapons to your advantage and make sure to control your popularity. I’m sure you wouldn’t want my army to tame your farm, we could even rebrand your great land to honor the lord's chicken. Either way, let us push back the tide and not allow that future to pass. Good luck and make me proud, you know I’m watching.”\nThe Colonel knew that Kanye's words could be a threat directed towards him, and all of Kentucky Fried Chicken, however, it was equally likely that these words were simple bolster. Regardless of Kanye’s words, his actions had spoken clearly. With the support of the Confederacy, the chances of the Colonel remaining in power had greatly increased. He was going to make Kanye eat those words and blow his expectations out of the water. But first, he would send Kanye a bucket of chicken."

The board watched as a young intern scrambled to turn on the projector, sweat was visibly showing through his white-collar shirt. Finally, the sound of a fan kicked on, and the old projector came to life. The intern said a small prayer and started his PowerPoint presentation.\n“As you can see, the conflict with Comrade Carlson has grown out of control, and our generals have rung the alarm that they need more supplies and troops. Both options would cut into our profit margins and have thus been deemed unacceptable by the board. However, President Kanye has gracefully offered to bear the cost and send support to turn the tide of this war in our favor. The supplies are already being shipped to our front lines, and projections show that this will have a statistically significant positive impact on our profits. Kanye has asked that we remember this act of kindness and that we work closely with his administration in the future.”\nThe intern ended his presentation, and the board members exchanged looks with one another. One lone voice breaks the silence, calling for a vote. The board agrees unanimously to accept the offer, beginning the Company's efforts to build a relationship with Kanye's Confederacy.\nAs the meeting begins descending into deeper discussion, the intern clears his throat, ending the growingly loud conversations.

The Tucker situation has caused many in our administration to fear that said infection could spread across the South. I shouldn’t have to remind the board that stability brings strength, and strength builds our economy. President Kanye is a businessman, he does business. Multiple of the Confederacy's finest military advisors will stay to oversee your progress. President Kanye hopes that these advisors will improve the training and service capabilities of your fine army. Let us work together, as two nations, to crush the commies where they stand. With that said, are there any concerns that the President should be made aware of?”\nThe Board members took in the minister's words and came to a consensus, “No Minister Tarrio, the Confederacy, and President Kanye have our full gratitude.”\nTarrio smiled a clasped his hands after leaning forward, “Good gentleman, let us begin this new era of peace with a drink.” "

Kanye, who I genuinely thought of as a friend once, has shifted away from his morals and sold his soul to the Capitalist machine that is West Virginia. We fight for those who died in the mines, we fight for those who died fighting for workers' rights, and we fight for the innocents who were murdered by a tyrannical regime held together by strings. We will never forget this betrayal, we will make them suffer, we will show the Confederacy just how fragile their peace truly is.”\nLocal reporters claim that Comrade Carlson has stalled military efforts to engage in humanitarian aid to the impacted regions. Some reports have even claimed Carlson himself worked with first responders at ground zero. While we cannot be sure of what the future will bring, we can be certain that the great Comrade will stop at nothing to make our lives better.

President Kanye sent an official request for the army of West Virginia to march west and crush the rebellion against the Colonel of KFC. While this decision could simply be justified based on profit projections, the Confederacy is pushing the Board to strongly consider intervening, which only muddied the decision process. The Board was in deep debate over the proposition and the vote was tied, 6 in favor and 6 against. The final vote fell to the founder, who agreed to hear out both sides one final time.\n“Sir,” one member from the opposition stood up, “we don’t have the military budget to undertake such an operation, nor would an intervention be in our shareholder's best interest. We must maintain our borders and rebuild what we have lost. The impact from Comrade Carlson has not yet come to pass.”\nThe debate shifts to the supporters of intervention, with one of the senior members of the Board standing up, “Sir with all due respect, we must conduct an intervention for the same reasons that the honorable gentleman brought up. We have not yet passed the impact felt by rebels in our borders, and therefore we have not yet established a sustainable peace. One must only look towards the situation in Kentucky, it was spawned by the same ingredients that caused our troubles. If we do not stomp out those who seek to strip us of our profits, we risk losing everything. Furthermore, let us not forget that promise we gave the Confederacy. We owe a great debt that must be repaid, and our company, this board, always pays their debts. We cannot abandon our allies; we must crush that rebellion before it crushes us.”\nThe Founder took in the argument and layered back in his chair.

While I have full faith in this operation, what are the logistical conditions that my team will need to adjust to?”\nMinister Tarrio paused and took out a legal pad. He flipped through the pages while taking in its contents before he spoke. “Colonel, we are currently preparing around 6,000 soldiers to cross over the Kentucky border through Tennessee. They will create chaos and force the Free Kentucky army to split in two. Furthermore, this show of force will appear as if the people of Kentucky want to follow your leadership rather than your opposition. These men will take orders directly from you, as President Kanye does not want the Confederacy to appear as an active participant in this war, at least not at this time. We have full faith in your abilities to command the situation without us overseeing your actions, but if you fail, we will know.”\nThe Colonel shook his head with a level of understanding, and the Zoom call concluded with conversations about potential plans for post-war."

This tour ended in the Colonel’s primary office, where Minister Tarrio began a conversation regarding the future of Kentucky.\n“President Kanye and the entirety of the Confederacy are proud of the work you have done Colonel. With your victory over“Free” Kentucky, the region can finally heal, and our borders can finally become stable once again. However, our agents have conducted research into the sustainability of your nation, moving out of wartime specifically, and there is a great level of concern about your nation's ability to hold together.”\nThe Colonel looked offended, “I will have you know that our nation has never been stronger nor more unified. We thank you for helping us get back on our feet, but we are not helpless.”\nMinster Tarrio straightened his tie before staring down the Colonel, “With all due respect, you are telling me this while sitting in a giant egg. I hope you understand our hesitation regarding your ability to rebuild. However, the Confederacy is willing to help Kentucky rebuild stronger than ever. We only ask that our two nations can grow closer, and while you are rebuilding, it would be best for the Confederacy to overview exactly where our money goes, for this will allow the best overall product.”\nThe Colonel sat back in his chair; fear had begun to show through his stoic expression. “Suppose I agree to these terms, will I have the Confederacy's word that my position won’t be challenged?”\nTarrio paused for a moment and walked to a window. “Your administration is not among our concerns; we only want to protect you and your interests. So, what will it be, are you ready to join a movement greater than ourselves, or would you rather free fall into the fire, as everything collapses around you?”"

The Confederacy hopes that Corporate West Virginia will join us along with the Colonel to establish unity in our region. The combined might of our armies would allow our three nations to be independent from any foreign influence. This pact would further allow our three nations to tie our economies together, strengthening our power not only militarily, but economically too. Finally, we have worked together well in the past, and our regions have become far more stable due to cooperation. With that said, we will respect any decision the board comes to. The decision will of course be yours to make, with that said, what is the board's opinion on the matter….”"

He was the man for the job. He needed to protect the people who lived within the Command Zone, and he needed to prepare them for the coming struggle.\n\nHis leuitenants came to him with two main plans. The first, to organise private enterprise and industry, like proper Red-Blooded capitalist Americans, and the rifles would follow. However, the other plan considered the rifle shortage.

They agreed to meet at this park before sunset and it was now nearly dark. Jeff Stankiewicz had ruled the area like a general rather than an administrator. They worried that he would be too busy making over-ambitious warplans like usual and forgot about this meeting they fought to have. After ten more minutes, Jeff and his posse would eventually meet them, naturally dressed up in their finest military surplus and brandishing their AR-15s.\n\n"You two better have a damn good reason as to why you called me out here today", Jeff snarled at the governors as his men watched on. \n\nBrad looked at Mark and took a deep breath as he collected himself. He knew what they were about to propose might not go down brilliantly. He collected himself and began to speak.\n\n"Democracy. This country was founded on free and fair elections and democracy. And this party, our party, the Republican party, was the party of both Idaho and Wyoming. Forget about Trump or Biden for a second and take a look at the interior. Is this what America would have wanted?" Mark said with a level of confidence that had arisen from his mental preparation. \n\nBefore Jeff could cut him off Brad began to continue their speech. "We are not asking you to stop your militia, or stop your fight against the Communists or Liberals or Democrats, we are not asking you to even step down from having a government role. But we are asking you to return genuine civilian rule. You can let your men roam the streets and we are willing to look the other way, but we are asking for a new election, a new state, one that Lincoln would be proud of. Jeffrey, you started your militia to 'fight for the people' so here is your chance to be their champion. I am begging you, we are begging you, give us back the ballot". Brad stated nearly out of breath from the anxiety from his response. \n\nStankiewicz began to ponder the request of these men, he then even began to ponder everything he had fought so hard to build and his beliefs.

Democratic protests continue to engage in gorilla terror attacks against local law enforcement, they have rallied around calls for freedom from oppression and that no one man should be above the law. On the other side, Republicans have engaged in more formal combat, with local militias combining forces to “liberate” their towns. Calls against a tyrannical government that collapses the liberty of others seem to be the spark for the right side of the political aisle. The capital government has already started mobilization of the military to tame this fire, though many question how effective such tactics could be, for as one Japanese military leader once said, “There is a rifle behind every blade of grass.” Only God knows of the terror that has become Texas, hold your children close tonight, because the morning may not come."

 alamo.3.d:0 "Breaking news: a terrorist attack on a Fort Worth power plant has caused the entire city to suffer a major blackout. While this action was originally thought to be a one-off arsonist attack, similar attacks in Dallas, Houston, and Austin have caused major fears of anti-Trumpist attacks across the Texas plains. Our glorious leader Dan Patrick has reassured the public that no such uprising is happening, and that the situation is under control.\n\nHowever, reports are coming out that fierce combat between terrorist groups and militias has led others to doubt our leaders' words. Local law enforcement seems to be stretched thin, we even have reports of casualties stretching into the low hundreds. One can hope the Texan government is able to bottle up this conflict, but we can only hope that our great leaders are able to keep their heads about them. Get some rest tonight, for who knows what will come in the morning."

State representatives were successfully evacuated, but the building was taken. In the aftermath, President Beto O'Rourke took center stage and gave a rallying speech to his supporters across the Lone Star State.\n\n“To all those who rage against totalitarianism, to those who refuse to be oppressed, to those who want to break their chains, I call you now to protect what all true Texans hold in their hearts. We will not be relegated to second class citizens by those who seek the end of democracy. One truth we must hold onto is that all are created equal under the eyes of God. The fight ahead will be a long night, but we must not let that deter us, for after this long night comes a bright new morning.”\n\nThese words seem to have fallen on death ears as many local militias and leaders have taken up arms to establish their own claims to Texan land. All of Texas is engulfed in war, with many local governments proclaiming martial law. Good luck to all our listeners, this is your news channel Local 58, signing off for maybe the last time in a long time."

We have reached a deal with various Kentucky government diplomats in order to secure that the civil war lands in favor of the Colonel. If we assist the Colonel's government we will see the state become a satellite of the CSA, which could expand our influence on the continent exponentially.

Multiple warlords have sprung up to fight against the Sanderite regime and some, like the Republic of Hollywood, declaring neutrality, hoping to save their lands from the incoming bloodshed. \nSpectators to the conflict watch warily as one of the most legible regimes to reunite this shattered America, collapses under its own weight."

 News_events.14.d:0 "Following the crisis in Ukraine, and the intense diplomatic actions in its wake, France and Britain have found themselves on resoundly opposite ends of reaction, with Germany taking France's side. The U.K. has called for immediate intervention in Ukraine to take the fight to Putin, while France has called for caution above all else and to strengthen the Baltic and Poland instead.

While the comet itself didn't physically do anything of scale, it did effect the populace mentality through both anger and nostalgia. For virtually everyone that had only seen the comet not through anticipation, but accident, and has reminded those who saw as as an injustice. What would have been a fantastical event under the (relatively) great peaceful period from before was now seen more of as a joke in an age of militants, warlords, and frauds. To both people who did and didn't see it, inside and outside the territory we control, this is seen as a neglectful embarrassment by the public."

 News_events.96.d:0 "To those familiar with the Mormon faith, you may be aware of the idea of Zion, a utopian society for the righteous, within the faith. In modern times, Zion has been more of an ideal to strive for rather than an actual location. That is until now. On the steps of the Salt Lake Temple, the once militant turned leader, Ammon Bundy, has declared a new Zion stretching from one end of the former U.S. to the other. Though normally such a declaration would be met with much scorn, it seems Bundy has made sure any such opposition has been thoroughly eliminated."

As the Second American Civil War draws to a close, Donald Trump Jr., has shocked the world by declaring the beginning of an American empire on the steps of the Capitol Building in Washington D.C. Trump Jr., now styling himself as the emperor of this new state, has made it clear that he intends to expand American influence to "unseen heights" in the near future.

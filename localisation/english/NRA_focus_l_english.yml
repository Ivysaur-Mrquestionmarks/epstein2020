Not only that, but our revolution in particular is facing the remnants of the ex-world’s strongest military power, meaning we cannot afford to be idealistic about our military doctrine when defending against outside threats. Several strategies have been drawn up that are being considered, with one of the more popular ones being to rely on a smaller but elite trained army that can at least be on par with the remnants of the US army. Other propositions are more theoretical, including ideas like mass conscripting the workers to have safety in numbers, or allowing local bands of revolutionaries to undertake a guerilla war similar to the theories presented by minds like Mao and Gonzalos. We must choose wisely, for our choice can be the matter of life or death for our revolution…"

We must lay down guerilla defenses in hopes of doing damage to the future invaders.

 NRA_Wisdom:0 "Local Wisdom"
 NRA_Wisdom_desc:0 "Literacy and education has always been a problem in rural American communities, Appalachia especially given its disconnected nature. However, that does not mean that the workers in our nation are all mindless idiots who only know how to drink and fight, many community members hold knowledge that the general public would benefit from, and given a lack of proper teachers within the nation, they would be prime candidates for tackling our literacy problems. The state will assign them to be public teachers, sharing the knowledge that they know to younger members of our nation that will help lay the groundwork for eliminating literacy in our workers. Granted, this has the risk of giving rise to certain members teaching unsavory ideas to our nation’s youth, but we cannot afford to be picky with eliminating literacy. Any amount of literacy gained is positive, whether it be secular or religious."

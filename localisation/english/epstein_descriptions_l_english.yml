 DESC_LEADER_VERMIN_SUPREME:0 "Vermin Supreme's story is an odd one, and one that nobody would have believed but half a year ago. Becoming one third of the American Free State’s Triumvirate and leading a successful revolt from the G.L.A.R. probably wasn’t on his 2021 to-do list. But these are strange times, and sometimes strange times yield strange circumstances. In any case, Vermin Supreme found himself locked in a balancing act with the Triumvirate’s two other members.\n\nVermin also finds himself as the recognized “spokesman” of the Triumvirate due to AOC and Mattis seeing him as the least likely to be a threat, but Vermin isn’t a complete fool. He dreams of a truly free America, free from useless government bureaucracy, and he trusts neither Mattis nor AOC to deliver on that dream.\n\nSo Vermin Supreme, alone, walks his path towards his idea of true liberty for the people of the AFS. He knows things cannot go on forever like this, but his followers have put their faith in him.\n\nIn Supreme We Trust."

His net worth is almost five times larger than former fighter Mike Tyson; that is a fact he is quite proud of and totally not made up as filler. He was very friendly with the states before the collapse and he thinks Venezuela is a threat. He does not recognize Venezuelan President Maduro as the rightful President of the country, opting to recognize Guiado instead. Minnis just wants to keep the Bahamas safe, not under the jackboot of the British Expeditionary Force or in the sphere of Venezuelan influence."

For the first time in years, Union Jacks and Royal standards fly above those of islands and territories once directly ruled by the crown. Nearly all of the Caribbean was absorbed into the Commonwealth; spearheading the Crown’s race for control of the Antilles was Sir Mark Charleton-Smith. A skilled general and military genius, Mark helped take control of islands from Barbuda to Grenada and helped secure a foothold for London in the new world once again. Perhaps the old adage of the sun never setting on the empire may be partially true with his forces of the Caribbean."

Canada is a nation still loyal to a throne, uses the metric system, and is more or less stable. To the international community it can be simplified even further from what it is to what it isn’t; the United States. Canada, unlike their southern neighbor, has not as of 2020 had a civil war descending into chaos. It has not as of 2020 led to a massive divide in the country leading to the deaths and displacement of thousands and the rise of warlords and rump states. And if there is a man to thank for that it’s Justin.\n\nYoung, good looking and wildly charismatic, Justin Trudeau leads the Liberal Party and Canada like a man of the people. He is far from perfect as his scandals of blackface and Indigenous court case battles still haunt him, but he was not a Trump or a Biden. He was simply a Canadian. Born on Christmas day in 1971, Trudeau grew up yearning to do something for the Canadian people. He wished to be like his father and help Canada keep their title of the “True North”.  And while it is debated and contested if he had lived up to his father’s legacy or has done well for his country there is one thing that is certain; He will not cause Canada to descend into a bloody and violent civil war.\n\nBecause why would a man like him do such a thing..."

He was born into an extremely wealthy family and using his connections easily became President within a few years of being in politics. He is an outspoken supporter of Republicans in the United States; he has been under scrutiny recently for flirting with the Denver Government.

While he continues to lead Cuba with the same iron fist like his brother, it is no secret his time left on this earth is limited. And a death in office would be terrible for the morale of his people. It would not be surprising as he retires for some younger blood. All Raúl can hope for in his successor is that he or she keeps alive the flame of his brother’s revolution from 1953."
 DESC_LEADER_MIGUEL_DIAZ_CANEL:0 "Miguel Diaz Canel, the first non Castro in office since Batista, is the leader of Cuba. He may not have been old enough to fight in the revolution or old enough to remember the struggles of the old regime but he was old enough to help build it later on. Having risen up the ranks of the CPC very quickly, Miguel is a party bureaucrat and is seen as a reformist. He has supported LGBT policies and mild regime liberalization over the years without getting jailed and has won the hearts of the party. After assuming office from Raúl, it is very clear his regime will be transformative to help keep the flame alive of Fidel’s revolution. The hammer and sickle of the party has been alive for over 60 years now, and if he leads his nation well Cuba may stay red for 60 more."

Attempted uprisings in these territories were swiftly put down, and Aquilino was made the reluctant head of a provisional military government with a mandate to liberate the mainland by any necessary means. The Pacific Fleet, once one of the mightiest naval forces on the planet, now faces declining morale, inadequate logistical support, dwindling fuel, and no end to the madness on the home front. But Aquilino and his men will not go quietly into the night."

Paula Mae-Weekes, a leader seen as fearless, does have one secret; she is actually petrified. Following the American collapse, the British Expeditionary Force seized nearly all of the islands in the Antilles… except for hers. Every day she wakes up afraid to see a landing of troops or that blasted Union Jack fly above the capitol building. She has heard horror stories of a colonial style government set up, turning once sovereign countries back into naval bases and tourist attractions for those blasted British bastards.

 DESC_LEADER_DONALD_TRUMP:0 "President. Patriot. Traitor. Oligarch. Donald J. Trump has earned many names since the fall of America.\n\nBorn in New York in 1946, the 45th President of the United States emerged in the spotlight in 2016 when he ran against Democrat Hillary Clinton, and enjoyed constant assault from his major opposition in the Legislature and media. Their attempts proved futile, and he went on to lead a controversial term. Then 2020 came, and his whole presidency came crashing down.\n\nTrump remained defiant and challenged the election results all through the remainder of the year, and finally culminated by his refusal to transfer power to Biden, the attack on DC by Bidenists, and the following period of anarchy. So he fled to the Midwest and organized his own Government in Denver. A government many call a oligarchy of his closest allies and a government of conspiracies. But Trump is not unintelligent. He now bides his time and waits. Waits for the chance to pacify the rogue warlords in the west and globalists in the east. He waits to reign in the South once again and moved to crush the Penceist traitors in Indiana. He waits to reunite America, and make it great again.\n\nAnd like Julius Caesar and the Rubicon, he will cross the Mississippi and assert his right as president. Whether the people want him or not."

 DESC_LEADER_NICOLAS_MADURO:0 "Venezuela has been the boogeyman of US foreign policy since the 1990s. Some might argue that title belongs to Iran or China, but with Venezuela being in the United State’s backyard it made things different. Under Chavez a proto-communist state led by a populist movement transformed Venezuela into a centralized and powerful state. But due to terrible handling of the economy because their only resources they really have is fossil fuels; Venezuela collapsed.\n\nNicolás Maduro now is the president following the death of Chavez, a man of which he does not share the same qualities of leadership. Hugo Chavez may have been a despot who let the political and economic factors of the state deteriorate but he was at least competent. He at least survived the US attempts on the government and was seen as a mildly good leader in the eyes of the neutral world. After the economy imploded and an election was deemed fraudulent by a non-existent, US backed opponent, internationally he struggled with recognition. Maduro knows that he only has some time before he is either overthrown, killed or exiled. Nicolás Maduro leads the rump state of what Venezuela once was, and as Caracas in 2021 is starting to look a lot like Weimar in 1921; the clock is ticking."

Wins serves as the superintendent of the Virginia Military Institute. Himself a graduate of the school in 1985, upon his appointment in late 2020 Wins immediately set about trying to improve the rock-bottom cadet morale caused by draconian and contradictory COVID-19 measures, repeated attacks against the Institute published in the Washington Post, and an ongoing state investigation of the school that saw the departure of its previous superintendent. While his first few months as superintendent saw a marked rise in cadet morale due to many of his new policies, this progress came to a halt when the Cadet Regiment was called up to help staunch the growing unrest within the state; when it became clear that the country would only continue to tear itself apart, General Wins and most of VMI's teaching staff were reinstated as officers and charged with leading the nascent Virginian Armed Forces."

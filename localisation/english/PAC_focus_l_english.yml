 PAC_continue:0 "Mobilize a Class III Draft"
 PAC_continue_desc:0 "In previous wars, one could obtain a Class III deferment from conscription if he was the sole breadwinner for his family. We must do away with this luxury if we hope to retake California."
 PAC_join_training:0 "Joint Military Maneuvers"
 PAC_joint_training_desc:0 "Conducting joint exercises with our Cascadian allies will give invaluable experience for our trainees and allow us to fast-track them to the front."
 PAC_canada_diplomacy:0 "Cooperate with the Great White North"
 PAC_canada_diplomacy_desc:0 "The defense policies of Canada and the United States have been closely aligned ever since the start of the Cold War. Let's see if we can leverage these ties in our diplomatic efforts."
 PAC_buy_rifles_CAN:0 "Canuck Arms Deliveries"
 PAC_buy_rifles_CAN_desc:0 "The Canadians have agreed to bolster our relatively meager industrial capacities with the manufacturing power of Colt Canada. All that remains now is to work out the logistics of the deliveries."
 PAC_infiltrate_the_sandarist:0 "Infiltrate the Reds"
 PAC_infiltrate_the_sandarist_desc:0 "While urban California is a bastion of leftism, the state's more moderate countryside has never been particularly fond of crazy edicts from Sacramento, and this is unlikely to change even with the advent of the secret police. We'll assign a few sleeper agents to try and can make contact with the local resistance there."
 PAC_sabotage_the_sandarist:0 "State-Sponsored Terrorism"
 PAC_sabotage_the_sandarist_desc:0 "While conducting terror attacks against American population centers and infrastructure is the very scourge we've spent the last twenty years trying to stamp out, to say nothing of violating International Humanitarian Law, such attacks are undeniably effective. We'll make an exception, just this once."
 PAC_5th_columb:0 "Operation: Wolverine"
 PAC_5th_columb_desc:0 "We have successfully made contact with several local resistance groups within the Californian countryside. On an agreed signal, they'll rise up and take charge of their local communities. While they face long odds of surviving the coming fight, their efforts should be enough to weaken the Communist front lines so our invasion forces can launch a decisive blow."
 PAC_fuel_1:0 "Fill the Pumps"
 PAC_fuel_1_desc:0 "If we are to continue operations against the Reds, we will need a steady supply of fuel. Let's ask our Canadian neighbors if they can spare any for our war effort."
 PAC_call_marines:0 "Recall Troops in Foreign Land"
 PAC_call_marines_desc:0 "When everything fell apart in January, we recalled most of our forces from the Asian theater, leaving behind a skeleton crew to take care of our bases. Since we won't be in any position to use those bases for the forseeable future, let's transfer control over them to our local allies so we can redeploy those men to the front."
 PAC_old_ships:0 "Restore the Old Fleet"
 PAC_old_ships_desc:0 "There are a number of older warships sitting in Pearl Harbor, waiting to be decommissioned. Let's refurbish them for one last tour of duty."
 PAC_shore_boming:0 "Boom Beach"
 PAC_shore_boming_desc:0 "Much of California's heavy industry is centered along its coastline. It'd be a shame if someone were to flatten it all with heavy naval bombardment."
 PAC_supply_sky:0 "Airdrop Supplies"
 PAC_supply_sky_desc:0 "We can use our air supremacy to ensure our forces remain well-supplied even if they become temporarily cut off from our supply network."
 PAC_operation_guam:0 "Operation: Guam"
 PAC_operation_guam_desc:0 "Our naval supremacy has allowed us to position a small invasion force just off the coast of San Franciso. When we're ready, let's use this force to establish a beachhead and then quickly push into the mainland."
 PAC_CRUSH_BERNIE:0 "Suffocate the Socialists"
 PAC_CRUSH_BERNIE_desc:0 "We'll make the Reds pay for their treachery. Push forward, and take back our homeland!"
 PAC_failed:0 "Lost the Battle..."
 PAC_failed_desc:0 "Although our invasion was a failure, we acquired a great deal of intelligence and knowledge on our foe. Every page discussing enemy tactics, every map showing potential Communist weak points, every training procedure developed in response to the Reds' underhanded schemes, all of it was bought with the blood of thousands of our finest men. Let's ensure that it doesn't go to waste."
 PAC_fuel_2:0 "Empty the Reserves"
 PAC_fuel_2_desc:0 "Our invasion expended most of our fuel supplies. Canadian fuel is no longer an option, so we'll have to tap into the civilian supply."
 PAC_fail_men:0 "Mobilize a Class IV Draft"
 PAC_fail_men_desc:0 "Class IV service exemptions apply to noncitizens, some government officials, religious ministers, individuals with prior military service, sole surviving sons, and those who are unqualified (be it for medical or other reasons) for military service. We must draft them all if we are to rebuild our force, as unpopular as that may be."
 PAC_fail_men_desc:0 "Class IV service exemptions apply to noncitizens, some government officials, religious ministers, individuals with prior military service, sole surviving sons, and those who are unqualified (be it for medical or other reasons) for military service. We must draft them all if we are to rebuild our force, as unpopular as that may be."
 PAC_fail_marines:0 "Cut Corners on Marine Training"
 PAC_fail_marines_desc:0 "We can expedite the deployment of our new Marine Divisions by axing any training topic that isn't absolutely necessary for combat performance - our newly-minted Marines can learn the rest when they get to their respective units."
 PAC_another_one:0 "...But not the War"
 PAC_another_one_desc:0 "That fool Sanders thinks we have no fight left in us. It's time to show him how wrong he is."
 PAC_China:0 "Shut down the Asian Supply Lines"
 PAC_China_desc:0 "The Chinese have sent an intervention force to stave off the collapse of their Californian puppet. Let's give them a black eye for their troubles."
 PAC_ships_china:0 "Our Allies around the Globe"
 PAC_ships_china_desc:0 "Simultaneously supporting naval landings and dealing with Chinese reinforcements have stretched our fleet thin. We should appeal to our allies to see if they can spare anything from their fleets for us."
 PAC_china_dockyards:0 "Convert the Mercantile Shipbuilding Industry"
 PAC_china_dockyards_desc:0 "Our civilian drydocks have lain dormant since the start of the conflict. Upgrading these facilities to military standards would be a cheap and expedient way to increase our warship production."
 PAC_staff:0 "Call upon our Atlantic Brethren"
 PAC_staff_desc:0 "We'll attempt to raise our counterparts on the East Coast via SATCOM transmission. Maybe they can provide some new insights about our tactical situation by looking at it with a few fresh pairs of eyes."
 PAC_militia_china:0 "The 1st 'Pearl Harbor' Division"
 PAC_militia_china_desc:0 "Since the start of our war with the Reds, several anti-Communist militias have sprung up, mostly composed of veterans who failed to meet the age requirements. While their equipment isn't up to the standards of our Marine Divisions, it would nonetheless be wise to integrate them into our existing order of battle."
 PAC_militia_china_2:0 "The 2nd 'Last Frontier' Division"
 PAC_militia_china_2_desc:0 "Our milita units have proven themselves to be adequate second-line troops, freeing up our Marines for more important tasks. We should increase their budget and help bolster their recruitment efforts."
 PAC_call_for_help:0 "A Call for Help"
PAC_call_for_help_desc:0 "Thus far, we've managed to survive without turning to the donkey and elephant in the room. However, if our war efforts are to succeed, we need to do more than just survive. It's time to make a formal request for support from either Trump or Biden."
 
 PAC_WIP:0 "The Great Debate"
 PAC_WIP_desc:0 "Having accomplished the Herculean task of retaking our homeland from the Reds, we now need to reassess our military structure for the long term."
 PAC_expand_army:0 "Raise Military Wages"
 PAC_expand_army_desc:0 "Increasing our soldiers' pay and benefits would be a great way to attract new manpower into the force."
 PAC_militia_creation:0 "Militia Training Program"
 PAC_militia_creation_desc:0 "Giving expanded pay to our militiamen encourage recruitment among members of the population who might not be interested in a four- or eight-year service obligation associated with enlistment."
 PAC_militia_formalisation:0 "Prussian Discipline"
 PAC_militia_formalisation_desc:0 "By conducting extensive training exercises and drills with our militias, we can train them to the point where they are only slightly below the caliber of our Marines."
 PAC_civilian_equipment:0 "Allow Civilian Weaponry in the Military"
 PAC_civilian_equipment_desc:0 "Letting militiamen serve using their own personal weapons will reduce the burden on our supply system while helping us reestablish the 'rifle-behind-every-blade-of-grass' deterrent that the Communists so unwisely chose to dismantle."
 PAC_support:0 "Routine Medical Check-Ups"
 PAC_public_debate:0 "Reintroduce the 1st Amendment"
 PAC_public_debate_desc:0 "Freedom of speech and peaceable assemby were both largely trampled upon during our war with the Reds. Their return is long overdue."
 PAC_local_police:0 "Use Militias as Police Forces"
 PAC_local_police_desc:0 "By having our militiamen pull double duty as MPs while we work to re-establish local police departments, we can both make the job more attractive to those interested in serving their local communities and build rapport with said communities."
 PAC_expand_militia:0 "Expand the Recruitment Campaigns"
 PAC_expand_militia_desc:0 "Signing bonuses and slick PR campaigns will help us reach even more potential militiamen."
 PAC_rebuild_californian_industry:0 "Rebuild the Golden State"
 PAC_rebuild_californian_industry_desc:0 "Reconstituting our industrial base is the first step we must take to get on the path to reunification."
 PAC_navy_ind:0 "Reopen Californian Industry"
 PAC_navy_ind_desc:0 "The first step to restoring California to fighting shape is rebuilding the heavy industry which we all but wiped off the map during the war"
 PAC_military_ind:0 "The Military-Industrial Complex"
 PAC_military_ind_desc:0 "Now that California's civilian industry has sufficiently recovered, we can now turn our attention to setting up production of new military equipment on the mainland."
 PAC_modern_army:0 "Keep our Guns Shiny and New"
 PAC_modern_army_desc:0 "When we liberated California, we had to make do with outdated weapons because those were all we had. Let's ensure that doesn't happen again."
 PAC_tanks_research:0 "The American Tank Legacy"
 PAC_tanks_research_desc:0 "Our struggle to retake the Californian mainland underscored the necessity of armored forces in modern warfare. While we still have some ex-tankers in our ranks as well as a small amount of documentation for the M1A1 Abrams, its heavy weight makes it unsuited for high-altitude fighting in the Rockies. We'll have to create some lighter designs ourselves."
 PAC_tanks_go_brr:0 "Tank Production go Brrrrr"
 PAC_tanks_go_brr_desc:0 "Rebuilding our armored corps is progressing too slowly. Additional purchases of the specialized machinery needed for thermal imagers and ceramic armor, traditionally among the most difficult components to manufacture, would help expedite the process."
 PAC_java:0 "Operation: Java"
 PAC_java_desc:0 "Now that our army is finally back on its feet, we should make preparations to secure the surrounding regions. A few skirmishes along our neighbors' borders should help remind them of their place."
 PAC_army_wins:0 "An Army with a State"
 PAC_army_wins_desc:0 "Strict regimentation and order among military and society alike helped us maintain order even in the face of the Red Menace. There is no reason to change what works."
 PAC_middle_wins:0 "The Militant Republic"
 PAC_middle_wins_desc:0 "Power should neither be held by a self-selected cadre of career soldiers nor distributed among every idiot in the state. American democracy, though flawed, was part of what made this country special among the world; it's high time that we brought it back."
 PAC_militia_wins:0 "The Army of Old America"
 PAC_militia_wins_desc:0 "Just like the Continental Army of old, we shall reorganize our forces around local militias, decentralizing our political system in the process."


 PAC_claims:0 "True Heir of America"
 PAC_prepeare_oerations:0 "Prepare for Reclamation"

 PAC_operation_midway:0 "Operation Midway"
 PAC_operation_midway_desc:0 "It's time to begin our reclamation of America."
 PAC_south_mid:0 "Look To The South"
 PAC_south_mid_desc:0 "Between the Neo-Nazis and the tribal separatists, the territory beyond our southeastern border is a mess. An effort to reassert control over the area is long overdue."
 PAC_sabotage_HOP:0 "Support The Natives"
 PAC_sabotage_HOP_desc:0 "Outside of the Neo-Nazis themselves, almost no one within the so-called 'Amerikareich' supports its schizophrenic regime, least of all the Native Americans whose reservations were occupied during its establishment. We'll begin covertly arming any resistance members we can find."
 PAC_sabotage_tribes:0 "Form A New Trail"
 PAC_sabotage_tribes_desc:0 "The tribes have outlived their usefulness as a buffer between ourselves and the Texans. It's time to start softening them up in preparation for our next push east."
 PAC_operation_cyprus:0 "Operation Cyprus"
 PAC_operation_cyprus_desc:0 "Texas' policy of armed neutrality has kept them out of the wider conflict thus far, but it also means that they have isolated themselves from any outside help. It's time to take full advantage of their shortsightedness and put an end to their secessionist ambitions once and for all."
 PAC_operation_aland:0 "Operation Åland"
 PAC_operation_aland_desc:0 "With the tribal states weakened from within, it's time to do away with them. This will finally put us within striking range of Texas." 
 PAC_operation_alcatraz:0 "Operation Alcatraz"
 PAC_operation_alcatraz_desc:0 "We crushed the original Nazis like bugs, but it seems their imitators not only failed to get the memo, but had the gall to establish a 'Fourth Reich' on our very soil. Every moment that vile regime continues to exist is another moment that our deceased veterans spend spinning in their graves. Let's destroy those bastards once and for all."
 PAC_operation_bermuda:0 "Operation Bermuda"
 PAC_operation_bermuda_desc:0 "Securing Las Vegas and Molossia will create a single, unbroken front against the Mormons, making our future invasion plans easier."
 PAC_operation_crete:0 "Operation Crete"
 PAC_operation_crete_desc:0 "The Mormon fanatics to our east are easily the greatest threat to our continued survival. Let's deal with them as soon as possible."
 PAC_prepare_for_the_desert:0 "Just like in Iraq!"
 PAC_prepare_for_the_desert_desc:0 "Our operations in Utah have shown that our forces are lacking in desert-warfare training. While we still have seasoned veterans of the War on Terror within our ranks, the vast majority of our army had little, if any, experience with arid conditions and suffered accordingly. Some large-scale training exercises are in order."
 PAC_operation_agnes:0 "Operation Agnes"
 PAC_operation_agnes_desc:0 "The fact that a terror state, run by the cartels and led by none other than the Unabomber, has been allowed to persist for so long on American soil is a national embarrassment. It's time to correct that."
 PAC_operation_falkans:0 "Operation Falklands"
 PAC_operation_falkans_desc:0 "Our Cascadian neighbors think that the defeat of the Reds means they are safe to continue their secessionist ideals. We'll make an example of them, and in the process regain control over the entire Pacific coastline."
 PAC_operation_bahamas:0 "Operation Bahamas"
 PAC_operation_bahamas_desc:0 "Montana is our last major obstacle to finally establishing a northeastern front against Trump. Their geographic isolation from the fighting has led to a sense of complacency and entitlement within their 'independent' government, of which we shall take full advantage during our forthcoming invasion."
 PAC_faith_of_the_hunters:0 "The Fate of the Mountains"
 PAC_faith_of_the_hunters_desc:0 "With Montana's government gone, there remains the question of what to do with their elite units of 'Hunters.'"
 PAC_operation_britain:0 "Operation Britain"
 PAC_operation_britain_desc:0 "Donald Trump's refusal to concede the election caused this whole mess, and we'll make sure that he suffers the consequences. Let's crush his rebellion once and for all!"
 
 
 PAC_militia_satate:0 "We Live in a Society"
 PAC_militia_satate_desc:0 "Our present political sphere is divided between left- and right-wing anarchist militias. Things going forward will be difficult, to say the least."
 PAC_what_we_disagree_on:0 "What We Disagree On"
 PAC_what_we_disagree_on_desc:0 "Arguments about economic policy in our minimalist state are the largest point of friction between our two sides. Perhaps we can find some common ground somewhere."
 PAC_stablish_the_communes:0 "Establish The Communes"
 PAC_establish_the_communes_desc:0 "The left-wing anarchists are unflinching in their desires to establish small communes across our nation. If we want to get anything done, we'll have to grant them at least this."
 PAC_communal_universities:0 "Free Universities"
 PAC_communal_universities_desc:0 "'Free' universities subsidized by payments from the communes sure seem like a rather roundabout way of funding them through taxation, but if the right-libertarian members of the government don't have to pay the costs, then they don't see a problem in approving them."
 PAC_communal_healthcare:0 "Free Healthcare"
 PAC_communal_healthcare_desc:0 "The left-libertarians of the government have again proposed commune-subsidized 'free' healthcare. The right-libertarians again see no problem so long as they aren't the ones footing the bill."
 PAC_local_elections:0 "Hold Local Elections"
 PAC_local_elections_desc:0 "With our economic and social changes passed and now taking effect, it's time to see what our people think about our new way of running the show."
 PAC_economic_liberalisation:0 "A Libertarian Economy"
 PAC_economic_liberalisation_desc:0 "Everyone in our government agrees that central banking and economic oversight are not just great statist evils, but unnecessary ones at that. It's time to do away with them once and for all."
 PAC_minimal_taxation:0 "No More Taxes... Or maybe a little..."
 PAC_minimal_taxation_desc:0 "While ending taxation entirely is still our goal, we still need to pay for our army somehow..."
 PAC_deregulation:0 "Deregulation"
 PAC_deregulation_desc:0 "Bureaucratic red tape has always been the scourge of any society. Let's do away with as much of it as we can!"
 PAC_what_we_agree_on:0 "What We Agree On"
 PAC_what_we_agree_on_desc:0 "Despite our differences, the libertarian left and right are both libertarian, and share viewpoints on most issues. Let's use our common ground to knock out some policy objectives."
 PAC_policeless_society:0 "Policeless Society"
 PAC_policeless_society_desc:0 "Police have no purpose in a society where everyone follows the NAP. Let's get rid of them all."
 PAC_against_opresion:0 "Fight Against Oppresion"
 PAC_against_opresion_desc:0 "Both sides of our state's libertarian-led government agree that the state itself is the biggest threat to man's freedom. Let's cut away as much as we can without causing everything to fall apart."
 PAC_small_bussneses:0 "Small Business"
 PAC_small_bussneses_desc:0 "The true creator of growth is not the oppressive federal government, but the local McDonald's and Wal-Mart. Let's loosen regulations so free enterprise can blossom in our great land."
 PAC_prepare_for_the_war_of_the_free:0 "Prepare The War For Freedom"
 PAC_prepare_for_the_war_of_the_free_desc:0 "We shall prepare to export our brand of freedom to the rest of the country. Unlike that clown Bush twenty years ago, we really mean it this time."

 PAC_consecions_to_the_army:0 "Concessions To The Army"
 PAC_consecions_to_the_army_desc:0 "Current budget proposals for cuts to military spending are not only foolish, but actively detrimental to our territorial integrity. Let's make sure our dear President understands these concerns."
 PAC_expand_military_falicilities:0 "Expand The Military Complex"
 PAC_expand_military_falicilities_desc:0 "It would be foolish to neglect our war industry when we are surrounded by enemies on all sides. Extensive bonuses, to be paid upon satisfactory completion of new factories, should help get things moving a little faster."
 PAC_focus_in_military_industry:0 "The Military Comes First"
 PAC_focus_in_military_industry_desc:0 "Using the law to forcibly accelerate the mergers of several civilian companies into our defense sector may be a heavy-handed approach, but it will significantly improve our military production."
 PAC_high_general_wages:0 "Increase The Wages Of Generals"
 PAC_high_general_wages_desc:0 "Being a field-grade is a difficult job, and being one in our current wartime predicament is even more so. A pay raise of a few percentage points should help encourage our more experienced commanders to stay on the job."
 PAC_high_soldier_wages:0 "Increase The Wages Of Soldiers"
 PAC_high_soldier_wages_desc:0 "There are many civilians among our population who would be interested in inking an enlistment contract were it not for the low pay, and as our economic recovery continues this issue is only likely to get worse if not corrected. It's time that the rank-and-file get some raises as well."
 PAC_sell_our_old_equipment:0 "Sell Our Old Guns"
 PAC_sell_our_old_equipment_desc:0 "We have several warehouses full of old rifles that could be put to better use. Let's sell them off and invest that money into developing our heavy industry."

 PAC_maintain_the_image_of_a_democracy_desc:0 "Despite our previous warning, that idiot Hicks continues his attempts to return us to the same 'democratic' foolishness that tore this country apart only a few short years ago. We'll have to explain to him that his government is useful only as a facade, and he its corresponding figurehead."
 PAC_health_care_dem:0 "HicksCare"
 PAC_health_care_dem_desc:0 "President Hicks has proposed a single-payer healthcare system similar to the ones used by European countries. While the costs incurred are rather eyewatering, it will nonetheless help us maintain our democratic appearance. We see no reason not to let him have his little policy victory."
 PAC_state_found_universities:0 "State Universities"
 PAC_state_found_universities_desc:0 "Prior to the war, Californian schools led the country in R&D output. It's time to restore these institutions to their former glory, albeit under careful watch for ideological subversives."

 PAC_unite_the_state_inisiative_desc:0 "Although our urban areas are mostly back to normal, the infrastructure in our rural areas has continued to crumble away to the point where it now jeopardizes the strategic mobility of our forces. A large reconstruction program will both help our operational ambitions and win over the people."
 PAC_end_state_loyalties:0 "End Loyalties to the States"
 PAC_end_state_loyalties_desc:0 "We've given that fucker Hicks so many chances to do his job properly, we've explained his role to him, we've reined in the power of his office, and yet he still refuses to toe the line. Our disputes with that bastard are becoming more and more public, and eventually we may have no choice but to put him before a firing squad if he keeps this up."
 PAC_build_a_new_america:0 "Build A New America"
 PAC_build_a_new_america_desc:0 "By using our military to undertake a massive public-works effort, we can not only expedite the completion of our Unite the State Initiative, but also further increase enlistment. The current job market will only help make service more appetizing."

 A_Woman_in_Power_desc:0 "From the Pacific NorthWest to the Mexican border, there is a woman in power. Conservatives hate her, progressives hate her and liberals call her a girl boss. Eleni grew up looking at the glass ceiling and yearned for the day to break it; today is that day."

 Celebrate_the_Establishment_desc:0 "Status Quo. Status. Fucking. Quo. That is what we want and that is what we need. Having congressmen fight about issues nobody would pay attention to, no crazy fights over which news was fake, all of that. The moment we stopped having the status quo because of that orange sleazeball the whole country fell apart. Many people think Biden is old and out of touch… good. But so long as it leads to a return to normal like the older days of this country we don’t care. To this let us celebrate the establishment!"

 Divert_Californian_Funds_desc:0 "Government spending is simply a part of the big government the GOP stands firmly against… that being said so long as spending isn’t raised but rather ''moved around'' it isn’t as bad.

 gkj.1.t:0 "He is Back"
 gkj.1.d:0 ""NO NO NO NO NO NO!" Barron cried as he tried to hold the doors of his office shut. "MY TIME IS NOT TODAY! I NEED MORE TIME! I NEED MORE TIME! I NE..." \n\n He was cut short by the blast of a breaching charge that sent him sprawling backward. Barron, like a scared dog, scampered behind his desk, still leering from the concussive force of the explosion. \n\nSoon footsteps could be heard entering the office. The smoke slowly fled away as one of the men began to circle the room. Barron, shaking from fear, could feel their footsteps resonate through the blood-soaked floor. \n\n "There you are my child." An ominous voice weaved its way through the smoke. Barron looked up from his fetal position under his desk to see a man leaning over him. "Old Grey Eye is here." \n\n "...How?" Barron whimpered. \n\n The figure walked closer protected by two armed convicts. "It's your fault kid..." \n\n The man slowly knelt near Barron and leaned forward. His face was a mangled mess of scars and burns but yet, a smile still was etched across his face in a sadistic and evil manner. "You should have cut my neck not my eye." \n\n "JEB?!" Barron looked up to see himself face to face with the man he tortured in prison for months. "How did you survive?" \n\n "The will of the Lord kept me alive Barron. It is the same will that allowed me to discover that the main waterlines to your government building were located directly under the prison in which I was held. It is the same will that gave me the ability to smuggle in hallucinogens and lace your water with them. It is the same will that allows me, John Ellis Bush, to lead a revolt against you and stand here now." Now Jeb leaned in even closer and whispered into Barron's blood-soaked ear, \n\n "It is the same will that gives me the throne of Florida and soon the whole country. Goodbye child." \n\n Jeb Bush stood up slowly, his battered body cracking as it moved. "Shall I finish him for you, my lord?" Asked one of the inmates behind Jeb.  \n\n"No" Bush replied. "He is still, just a boy. Even if the Lord states that the sins of the father will become unto the son, we are not yet God's holy judgment" Jeb placed a hand on the inmate’s shoulder. "Take him to Denver to be with his father. You will die by his will and no one can know where you are from."  \n\nJeb touched his forehead to that of the inmate’s. The man was moved to tears, not those of fear or sadness but those of joy. He dropped to his knees as if the world itself was placed upon his back. \n\n"I am beyond honored my Lord and I shall do you bidding as it is by his will" He quickly grabbed Barron and began to drag him out of the office. Jeb held up a hand and the inmate stopped dragging Barron. Slowly, Jeb knelt down and drew close to Barron's ear. \n\n"My boy, this has been the goal from the begining." He whispered. "After all, who do you think had Eric killed?" \n\n Barron flew into a fit of rage but could not manage to hit Jeb as the inmate resumed dragging him down the hall. Jeb smiled. Everything was falling into place. Soon America would come to pay for its sins. "

 gkj.2.t:0 "Floridian Civil War"
 gkj.2.d:0 "In the time since Jeb Bush has stepped down, the state of Florida has devolved into chaos. The army, navy and air force have all but disbanded, the economy has collapsed and massive shortages have began to ravage the populace. With no government above them, the Floridian people have started to flock to whoever can give them food and saftey. \n\n In the South-East Miami governer Francis Suarez has managed to gather a small following and unite many of the big cities in the southern regions. Despite his more moderate stance and Republican background, Suarez has a following of mostly Democrats and other moderates under his reign. \n\n In the West the Seminole nation has arisen to reclaim their lands. A long since conquered nation, the Seminoles where subjected to war, famine and the infamous Trail of Tears. Since tribe leader Marcellus Osceola Jr. declared the nation's begining, many people with Semionole ancestry have flocked back into South-Western Florida to seek a new life. \n\n To the East, on the island of Cape Canaveral, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration has clamed much of the land. Not much is known about the nation thus far. They seem to be ruled by a small group of top scientists within NASA and are as secretive than they are wise. Time will only tell what they have in store... \n\n To the West all hell has broken loose. The massive whiplash the military was put through from Barron to Jeb caused a massive amount of desertion. No place felt it worse than St. Petersburg where the lot of its prisioners were freed by a mob. This bizzare mob is made up of other convicts from different jails around the state. Many of them call Tex Watson their leader, though others are just wanting nothing other than pure chaos. The Florida men control the West coast and who knows what their next move will be..."

When he returned he informed the local Miami legislature that a group of convicts had captured the four and forced them to kill each other or die of starvation.

This was not the case today. \n\n"Brother and Sister in Christ! I have returned!" Jeb yelled through into the crowd. "Today marks the begining of a new America. Today marks the day we wake up from the burdens of our sins and transgressions. Today marks the day that we live! I am pleased to say that God has guided me out of prison and before you here to deliver this good news. I still do not know my true purpose as of yet but I am sure that God will deliver it to me in due time. When that time arriv... \n\n Jeb frose dead in his tracks and his one good eye opened wide as if he saw a ghost. "Speak Lord, for I, your good and faithful servant is listening." Jeb said quietly. A few moments passed. The crowd looked on with puzzled looks on their faces, wondering what the hell was going through Jeb's head. Soon enough, Jeb snapped out of it and regained himself. \n\n"I have just been given the plan from God through Gabriel. God has told me his plan, his master plan. You must follow it no matter what my children." \n\nJeb paused a moment before giving a sigh, looking down and then slowly spoke to the crowd. \n\n"God has said that..."

Since its founding in 1954 by the late Fred Phelps, it has stood against the homosexual epidemic here in the United States along with other important issues. Though Fred has died, his youngest son, Timothy, is still living. It would be wise of us to elevate the status of this church in our new nation."

This was all set in motion by the nations leader, Jeb Bush. In Jeb's mind, the former city of Miami was not "free of its sin" and was declared unfit to remain standing. He vowed to bring it to its knees, which he seemingly has done. Death reports are still hard to obtain as many reporters and news outlets have been shot or detained upon entering the city. Using UN patrol boats, the offical estimated number from seems to be over ten-thousand."

Jeb had many options to consider. \n\nShould he allow all people to exist within his nation and take the hard task of converting them to our holy ways? \n\nPerhaps he should only focus on those already christian and help them see to tweak their beliefs. \n\nMaybe even go a step further and only accept the pre reformation christians. Their more staunch view of christianity will surley help them follow us. \n\nJeb stopped in his tracks. He looked out into the streets of New Jerusalem, still suffering from its sin. "Maybe there is no hope for the sinner," He murmered. "Perhaps God wills me to deliver his holy judgement. Perhaps this country is Sodom and Gomorrah," \n\n\n\n"and I am the flame.""

"Salvation is here." \n\nA older man stood up from a kneeling cicle of praying chruch members. He fixed his suit and slowly approached Jeb. \n\n"The Lord told me of your arrival." He said calmly, extending his hand toward Jeb's. "I have gathered out congregation for prayer for your triumph over the evils of this land." \n\nJeb smiled.

Since then it has been his to lose and he hasnt done it yet. Both Cascadia and Bernine Sanders have tried to bing him down but by strength and devotion to God alone he was able to ward off the demons of hell." \n\nJeb Bush finished the article and closed the newpaper. "Powerful words coming from the Westboro Baptist Church Gazette." He said waving the newspaper around. "Are these words true my child?" \n\nFrom the forrest Matt Shea emerged. He was clad in a ghillie  suit and covered in face paint. "You certainly have a way of getting my attention John," Shea said as he removed his hat. "Not every day you see the leader of a country enter my neck of the woods alone." \n\nAs he said this Shea pulled back a large piece of cloth that covered a Desert Eagle .50 cal on his hip. The gun was etched from barrel to muzzle in scripture. \n\n"Very impressive." Jeb retorted. "But I am here to say you no longer need to hide. No more hiding. This nation needs you at my side." \n\n "And what praytell are your plans for this nation?" \n\n"However, in the cities of the nations the LORD your God is giving you as an inheritance, do not leave alive anything that breathes.

Just to rub it in my face he did it with a Rhino tusk." Jeb let out a little chuckle. "Ironic." \n\nGeorge was taken back slightly. He knew Jeb, but not THIS Jeb. As the car moved from the landing stip onto a main road George really wondered if Jeb was still in there. \n\n"So about my proposal?" Jeb said continuing to stare forwards. "Have you given it some thought?" \n\n"I have, but Jeb... I..." George began to stutter a bit as he wrung his hands. \n\nJeb turned to his brother and placed his hands ontop of George's. "Hey, George. This is your brother talking. No one here is going to harm you. After all, I was the one who won you that election all those years ago." \n\n"I know, I'm just worried what the people of Texas will think." \n\n"They are a God fearing people and if they aren't, I will remove them from the equation." \n\nGeorge took a deep breath and relaxed as the convertable began to move in a parade through downtown Dallas. "Alright then John, I'll bring Texas to your side." \n\n"Atta boy." Jeb responded smiling. He threw one arm around George as the car continued its path through the city. "I knew I could trust you." \n\nAll while saying this, Jeb's opposite arm hung down on the side of the car, his fingers tightly gripping a small pen shapped button.

And as Psalms 119:105 says "Your word is a lamp unto my feet and a light unto my path." And you my friend," Jeb got closer to Kenneth till he was mere inches away from his face. "You are one bad light." \n\nBy now Copeland was sweating bullets and could not keep himself together. "Ephesians 4:32! "Be kind to one another, tenderhearted, forgiving one another, as God in Christ forgave you."" \n\n "Revelation 22:18-19!" Jeb yelled in retort. "I warn everyone who hears the words of the prophecy of this book, if anyone adds to them, God will add to him the plagues described in this book, and if anyone takes away from the words of the book of this prophecy, God will take away his share in the tree of life and in the holy city, which are described in this book."" \n\n "Matthew 7:12!

"You hypocrite, first take the log out of your own eye, and then you will see clearly to take the speck out of your brother's eye!"" \n\n "Am I not that brother in Christ?!" Copeland screamed. "Am I not a fellow beliver?!" \n\n"Not to me!" Jeb then stormed out of the room and behind the two way mirror. He smacked a large red button that made a loud alarm set off. The vents of the interrogation room began to spill out a putrid gass. \n\n"You have preverted the word of God long enough!" Jeb yelled over the intercom.

He still couldn't figure out why the church was left untouched or why he was thrown into this limo only a few hours ago. Timothy wasn't even on the board of elders for Westboro Baptist. He slowly put his head in his hands as he tried to think. \n\n "Son," Jeb said out of the blue. "We have... removed all of the elders of Westboro Baptist Church and laid the blame on retreating Trumpist soldiers." Jeb sat up and leaned forward. "You will be the obvious choice to take the pulpit every Sunday. I need you to expand your following and preach, no, radicalize the people of this nation to my cause. Can you do this?" \n\nTimothy shivered. The mere presence of Jeb was enough to scare him shitless. He quickly looked out the window to try and divert the conversation. \n\n"If you don't," Jeb murmered. "I will find someone who will." \n\n"I can do it" Tim said quietly. "I just need time to gather back my congregation." \n\n"Already done." \n\nAs they neared the city, Timothy saw the entrie congregation out in the streets praising Jeb and the troops as they rolled along.

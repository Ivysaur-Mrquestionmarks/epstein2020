 wisconsin.1.t:0 "The State of our State"
 wisconsin.1.d:0 "As a new era rises over America, we must address the situation Wisconsin now finds itself in. Having been created by an almost exclusively anti-GLAR coalition, we must decide how this Coalition of the Willing should lead. The traditional answer would be to focus on political stability—keeping our people secure and well-fed. However, exceptional times call for exceptional measures: even though they may lack military experience, should our political class lead from the front, inspiring morale in the troops and hope in the people?"
 wisconsin.1.a:0 "Our leadership will be political"
 wisconsin.1.b:0 "We must lead from the front"

 #event 3: DET accepts meeting
 wisconsin.3.t:0 "The [DET.GetName] Delegation Arrives"
 wisconsin.3.d:0 "When the delegation arrived, there was a sense of optimism in the air, smiles all around and a general feeling of goodwill. After hours of negotiation, most of the plan had been laid out: the [KMT.GetName] would receive all Wisconsinite territory, along with the Illinois lands currently controlled by the [GLA.GetName]. In turn, the [DET.GetName] was awarded the former territory of Michigan, as well as the Indianan and Ohioan regions held by the [GLA.GetName].\n\nThe meeting was nearing its end when a thought crossed [KMT.GetLeader]’s mind: the Upper Peninsula. Without it, we would remain just as exposed as we are now, if this alliance collapses in the future. And that strip of land... Wasn’t it artificially handed to Michigan back in 1836?\n\nIs it time to right that wrong?"
 wisconsin.3.a:0 "Ask for the Yoop"
 wisconsin.3.b:0 "We are satisfied"

 #event 4: DET rejects meeting
 wisconsin.4.t:0 "[DET.GetName] Rejects our Request"
 wisconsin.4.d:0 "Just when we thought the stars had aligned and we might gain an ally in our struggle against the [GLA.GetName], we were struck by the harsh reality of this new America."

 wisconsin.5.d:0 "The meeting was about to end, having agreed on the territorial division of the [GLA.GetName]'s territorial division, among state lines, with us getting Michigan, Indiana and Ohio territory and the [KMT.GetName] getting Wisconsin and Illinois territory. Suddently, a big comotion among the Wisconsinite delegation started. When in it was over, [KMT.GetLeader] asked for the Upper peninsula of the state of Michigan. Should we acquiesce?"
 wisconsin.5.a:0 "No. Also threat to pull out of the negotiations in the issue is pressed again"
 wisconsin.5.b:0 "Sounds like a fair request"
 
 #event 6: DET rejects Yoop agreement
 wisconsin.6.t:0 "[DET.GetName] Refuses to the Upper Peninsula Deal"
 wisconsin.6.d:0 "The [DET.GetName]'s diplomatic delegation has refused to agree to our request for Wisconsinite control of the Upper Peninsula. They have also threatened to pull out of the negotiations if the issue is pressed again. What should we do?"

 #event 13: Launch a Raid into GLA?
 wisconsin.13.t:0 "A Raid into the [GLA.GetName]?"
 wisconsin.13.d:0 "With the start of our Guerrilla warfare initiative, some millitary minded people have suggested that we should put our new capacities to the test. An idea of a small raid into the [GLA.GetName] was floated arround. With the objective of gaining experience and steal some weapons, many are supporting this initiative. On the other hand, the skeptics argue that we should not risk human and material loss on such a small endeavor.\n\nWhat should we do?"
 wisconsin.13.a:0 "We shouln't gamble on our security"
 wisconsin.13.b:0 "Maybe a smaller party could do the job"
 wisconsin.13.c:0 "Launch the raid"

 #event 14: Successful Raid
 wisconsin.14.t:0 "Successful Raid!"

 wisconsin.15.a:0 "Curses"

 #event 16: Successful Raid (GLA Prespective)
 wisconsin.16.t:0 "The [KMT.GetName] has Raided Us!"
 wisconsin.16.d:0 "A small party of Wisconsinite raiders crossed into our zone of control and wreaked havoc.

 wisconsin.17.t:0 "The [KMT.GetName] Tried to Raid Us!"
 wisconsin.17.d:0 "A small party of Wisconsinite raiders crossed into our zone of control and attempted to wreak havoc on our land. We believe their objective was to steal weapons, kill members of our security forces, and sow fear among our citizens. Fortunately, their plan was foiled, and they were swiftly dealt with. Let this serve as a warning: no one challenges the [GLA.GetName] without consequences."
 wisconsin.17.a:0 "Fools"

 #event 18: Militia Dilema
 wisconsin.18.t:0 "What to do With the Weathermen?"
 wisconsin.18.d:0 "In opposition to the chaos unleashed by the GLAR, various groups have united to restore order to the state. The Weather Underground Organization, however, stands as something of an exception. While not fully aligned with the Coalition of the Willing, they have cooperated with our leadership in the fight against [GLA.GetName].\nThey are undeniably useful, and we cannot afford to disarm or dismiss them, at least not yet. If we choose to leave them alone, they may continue their efforts, but without state support, their impact will be limited. On the other hand, if we back them officially, we risk empowering a group that may turn on us once [GLA.GetName] is no longer a threat. This is a delicate matter.\n\nShould we support them or simply leave them be?"
 wisconsin.18.a:0 "We need all help we can get"
 wisconsin.18.b:0 "We really shouldn't embolden extremists"

 #event 19: Our Future
 wisconsin.19.t:0 "Our Future"
 wisconsin.19.d:0 "Only days after our great victory over the [GLA.GetName], the flame that once united us begins to flicker. Republicans and Democrats have resumed their bickering over economic policy. Catholics and Progressives clash over social values. The judiciary appears more interested in expanding its own influence than delivering justice. And the militias... as always, they act without restraint, fueling unrest and radicalization across the land. They will be the first to be dealt with. Now, [KMT.GetLeader] must turn inward, to reflect not only on the path ahead for the [KMT.GetName], but on his own future in this fragile new order."
 wisconsin.19.a:0 "[KMT.GetLeader] orders the Coalition to stand by"

 #event 20: Disband succesfull
 wisconsin.20.t:0 "The Weathermen Disband!"
 wisconsin.20.d:0 "As we ordered the Weather Underground Militia to lay down their arms, some feared retaliation. That did not come to pass. In truth, thanks to the coalition's earlier difficult but wise decision not to embolden them during our time of need, the militia struggled to grow and failed to sink their tentacles deep into our institutions and communities. Though a few minor protests were raised, this outcome marks yet another success for the coalition."
 wisconsin.20.a:0 "Great!"

 #event 21: Disband unsuccesfull
 wisconsin.21.t:0 "The Weathermen Refuse to Disarm!"
 wisconsin.21.d:0 "As we attempted to disarm the Weather Underground Militia, our worst fears came true. Empowered by the coalition’s earlier decision to support them during the war, they had grown bold—and deeply rooted. There is no denying their role was crucial in securing our victory against the [GLA.GetName]; their fighters bled and triumphed alongside our own. But that very success fueled their rise. Now, as we seek to restore order and stability, their leaders refuse to stand down. They claim betrayal, rallying supporters with cries of revolution and justice. What once seemed like a necessary alliance has turned into a dangerous insurrection. The price of our past reliance on radical allies has come due."

This choice we make will shape the moral and political identity of our state."

Instead of direct confrontation, we will pursue a subtler tactic: entryism.

 CSA_fund_gun_r:0 "Fund Weapon Testing"
 CSA_fund_gun_r_desc:0 "Now that we have started to fund our new military, it is time to develop new infantry equipment. A solider is only as good as their rifle, and to be honest, the rifles we have are not that great. Let’s fix that."
 CSA_mils:0 "Invest in Military Infrastructure"
 CSA_mils_desc:0 "Attention all epic tax payers. The military needs your help! They are desperate for funding and without it we could easily succumb to a foreign force. The only way we can help them is with the front numbers on your credit card, the expiration date and the 3 didgets on the back. Hurray! We need to boost their budget before Sleepy Joe or the Orange Cyclops get us!"

 CSA_repay_loans_desc:0 "Collecting large amounts of debt is a bad idea. Let's make sure we pay back our loans so we do not get caught up in pointless interest payments."
 CSA_sort_out_the_mess:0 "Sort out the Mess"
 CSA_sort_out_the_mess_desc:0 "Politically speaking, the Confederacy is not in the best situation.\nThe goverment is full of white supremecists and black nationalists more focused on fighting each other than running the Confederacy. President West and other government higher-ups are only interested in holding onto power, not caring about what happens to the Confederacy.\nThere won't be any Confederacy left if we don't do something." 
 CSA_the_right_hand_man:0 "My Right-Hand Man"
 CSA_the_right_hand_man_desc:0 "Enrique Tarrio is the second-in-command for the Confederate government. He will act as Kanye’s right hand and he will hold great influence over our domestic and foreign policy; however, his sympathies towards Denver mean we should keep an eye on him."
 CSA_Confederate_nostalgia:0 "Confederate Nostalgia"
 CSA_Confederate_nostalgia_desc:0 "Nostologia for the Confederacy in the South was huge before the war. Despite being over a hundred years removed from the first Confederacy, some people in the South would rather whistle Dixieland then the Star Spangled Banner. Using this nostologia, we can instill a stronger level of patriotism and loyalty to our state."
 CSA_restore_segregation:0 "Segregate Dixie"
 CSA_restore_segregation_desc:0 " There have been calls by both white and black nationalists to reinstate some form of racial segregation in an attempt to curb the political violence against the two groups.

 CSA_Condeme_extrism_limited:0 "Condemn Extremism"

 CSA_Centralise_power:0 "Centralize Power"
 CSA_Centralise_power_desc:0 "We have come to the conclusion that in order to get anything done we need to centralize the power of the government to just Kanye West and the Birthday party.

 CSA_the_comittie:0 "The Confederate Committee"
 CSA_the_comittie_desc:0 "In order to get anything done, we shall form a committee between the most far left and far right black nationalists and the most extreme and violent white nationalists. Having Klansmen and Black Panthers sit in the same room to agree on politics sounds like the start of a joke, but it’s our new reality. Not many men can acheive such a feat, but Kanye West is not just any man..."
 CSA_Glorify_the_csa:0 "Glorify the Confederacy"
 CSA_Glorify_the_csa_desc:0 "The Confederate States of America was more than just an insurrection; it was an idea. 13 brave southern states decided to stand up to those Yankee bastards in defiance to their tyranny. We shall immortalize their bravery by continuing on in their footsteps."
 CSA_condem_slavery:0 "Condemn Slavery"
 CSA_condem_slavery_desc:0 "It may be debated, but deep down everyone knows the real reason the South left was states rights... to own slaves. While the concept of this great nation solely exists on Confederates leaving the Union to own other people, we are a different Confederacy. We shall formally condemn our nations' disturbing history with slavery and focus on our bright and prosperous future!"
 CSA_Glorify_confederate_generals:0 "Gods and Generals"
 CSA_Glorify_confederate_generals_desc:0 "The generals that left the Union to fight for their states were not traitors but heroes. Victors of combat are the ones who write the history of the combat they were in.\nIf America had lost in 1776, then Washington would have been seen as a rebellious commander and a footnote in English history books."
 CSA_Lee_doctrine:0 "Legacy of Lee"
 CSA_Lee_doctrine_desc:0 "Robert E. Lee is perhaps one of the best generals in both Confederate and American history. His leadership, tactics, and character are all something that everyone can learn from. Our generals can learn from his brave strategies and our people can see him as a model for the Southern citizen. Glory to Lee! Glory to the Confederacy!"

 CSA_fortify_the_floridan_borden_desc:0 "Florida may be lead by a child, but that does not mean we can let our guard down. Barron Trump is still a Trump with a cult following, and he is unpredictable. We do not know his ambitions, but we do know that we shall start to militarize the border."
 CSA_fortify_the_trump_borden:0 "Fortify the Mason-Dixon Line"
 CSA_fortify_the_trump_borden_desc:0 "Our border with Trump is both our largest and most dangerous. Just one incident could start a war in the name of "reclamation". We need to act quickly and build a fort line to slow down a possible Trumpist horde."
 CSA_fortify_the_texas_borden:0 "Fortify Against Texas"
 CSA_fortify_the_texas_borden_desc:0 "Texas has a comically large army and could wipe us off the map without the proper fortifications. They may be fellow southerners, but under their administration we do not know if we can trust them."

 CSA_equipment_update:0 "Update our Guns"
 CSA_equipment_update_desc:0 "Most, if not all, of our military's small arms are what our troops had at home. A bunch of hunting rifles all using different ammunition is a logistical nightmare. To put a stop to this, we shall adopt and distribute a national service rifle."
 CSA_artillery_update:0 "Legacy of Thomas Henry Carter"
 CSA_artillery_update_desc:0 "Our artillery is quite literally what is left over from army arsenals and what we were able to scrounge up from museums. This can not stand and we shall make the effort to replace our decaying artillery."

 CSA_tac_boomers_rb_1_desc:0 "In 1865, the South was left decimated by those Yankee bastards. Now the times are different, we shall raze those cities with a fleet of new B-52s!"
 CSA_naval_boomers_rb_1:0 "Safeguard the Confederate Navy"
 CSA_naval_boomers_rb_1_desc:0 "A massive naval blockade during the Civil War is what brought an end to the South. The inability for the Confederacy to import any goods or supplies was horrendous and crippled their war effort.\nWith the new technology of naval aviation, we can prevent this from ever happening again."
 CSA_strat_boomers_rb_1:0 "Strike the Furthest Yanks"

 CSA_integrate_paramilitaries:0 "Welcome Paramilitaries"
 CSA_integrate_paramilitaries_desc:0 "The South is littered with paramilitary groups. They are armed to the teeth, politically motivated, and ready to kill; perfect. We can easily integrate loyalist paramilitaries into the armed forces, but which ones shall we choose?"
 CSA_2_state_of_emergency:0 "Declare Martial Law"
 CSA_2_state_of_emergency_desc:0 "The CSA is slowly cracking, with tensions between black and white nationalists heating up day by day. It is clear that if we don’t do anything to placate these groups, then our new Confederacy will tear itself apart due to conflicting interests and beliefs. Whilst it pains President West, the nation must be put under martial law, and the authority of the Confederate government reinforced. At the very least this will give us the power needed to look into these nationalist groups and bring any treasonous plans to light."
 CSA_2_start_an_investigation:0 "Direct the Presidential Guard"
 CSA_2_start_an_investigation_desc:0 "Whilst martial law is underway, we cannot ignore the most glaring risk we face: the security of President West. Our secession from the Union was hardly unanimously supported, as many pro-Union citizens protested the secession. That, coupled with the current tensions from the nationalist groups due to martial law, increases the risk of an assassination attempt substantially. To counteract this, security of the president is a top priority during these times, as well as the security of other top officials within the Confederacy. Hopefully this will help quell risks of a potential act against the president’s life."
 CSA_2_investigate_the_phanters:0 "Investigate Black Nationalists"
 CSA_2_investigate_the_phanters_desc:0 "Despite being given degrees of autonomy in order to balance out the demographic inequality, recent actions by black nationalist groups have sparked concerns about them disrupting national stability. Constant attacks against the non-black populace by people loosely associated with these groups, as well as constant aggression against government officials, has sparked calls to formally investigate these groups in order to determine just how dangerous they are. Potential evidence against these groups could give us enough power to finally put an end to their aggression against us and the people."
 CSA_2_investigate_the_klan:0 "Investigate White Supremacists"
 CSA_2_investigate_the_klan_desc:0 "Despite making up a majority of our support base initially, it is clear that the white supremacist groups are becoming increasingly hostile to our government. Our fair treatment of the black populace has angered those wanting to return to the “good ol’ days” of Jim Crow, not to mention President West not being the “ideal” candidate many were suspecting when the 2nd Confederacy formed. Because of this, we must investigate these groups so that we can prevent potential lynchings and attacks that could be carried out against the black populace, as well as obtaining substantial evidence to potentially crack down on these groups to ensure internal stability."
 CSA_2_use_the_oportunity:0 "Don't Waste a Good Oportunity"
 CSA_2_use_the_oportunity_desc:0 "Recently, there has been an idea floating around the president’s office. Since tensions between white and black nationalists continue to rise, there has been a proposition to stage several false flag attacks against government offices and officials in order to get the evidence needed to finally put an end to the two groups. Many of the officials chosen as targets have long been suspected of being disloyal or even corrupt, which will allow President West to further secure his power and further his ideas without much opposition. Not only that, but staging attacks against civilian targets will bolster public support for actions against these groups. Whilst our citizen’s lives are sacred and deserve protection, sometimes we have to break some eggs to make an omelette…"
 CSA_2_restructure:0 "From the Ground Up"
 CSA_2_restructure_desc:0 "The Confederate Armed Forces are practically nonexistent as of late. We have mainly relied on the armed wings of the nationalist groups within the Confederacy, most of which are semi-untrained volunteers fighting for ulterior political motives rather than the defense and safety of the country as a whole. It is clear that we must begin forming a proper, non-political army that serves the interests of the country as a whole, not for petty reasons such as ideology and racism. It will be a time consuming and arduous effort, however if we wish to match and surpass any potential invaders from the North or West, we have to be ready."
 CSA_2_eliminate_rival_factions:0 "Crack Down on Opposition"
 CSA_2_eliminate_rival_factions_desc:0 "It is clear that the formation of our new armed forces will not be well received by our previous standing “army”. Groups like the Black Panthers will see it as a way for us to “oppress” their people by depriving them of a biased defense force, and the white-supremacist groups will have “constructive” criticism of the mere notion of mixed race battalions. We are already seeing incidents at numerous recruitment stations where recruitment officers are both verbally and physically assaulted by supporters of both groups. We are going to need to crack down on this sort of sentiment by posting armed guards at recruitment stations, dishing out severe punishment to those attack supporters of our plans, and making sure that certain groups will be pacified once and for all."
 CSA_2_eliminate_the_klan:0 "Ban Racial Supremacy"
 CSA_2_eliminate_the_klan_desc:0 "It comes as no surprise that there are many within our country who subscribe to the ideals of white supremacy. This is more evident within many groups that made up our armed forces previously, and there have been reports of these white supremacists taking action against innocent civilians within the Confederacy itself. It is clear these ideas cannot persist in our new Confederacy, especially in our professional army. All current white supremacist groups will be told to stand down and give their weapons up, being arrested or killed if they attempt to resist. Furthermore, soldiers will be severely punished if acts of racial aggression against their fellow soldier are discovered. Racial supremacy goes both ways after all, and neither are allowed within our Confederacy."
 CSA_2_eliminate_the_phanters:0 "Neuter the Panthers"
 CSA_2_eliminate_the_phanters_desc:0 "Whilst bearing noble origins, the Black Panthers have steadily become a thorn in the sides of many white Confederate citizens as of late. They are constantly attacking and berating innocent white civilians, whilst also prioritizing and putting the needs of black civilians above every other demographic in our Confederacy. It is clear they currently hold no sympathy for the non-black citizens inside our country, and the time has come to put an end to this blatant discrimination. All radical elements within the Panthers organization will be disarmed, with automatic arrest warrants authorized if there is any resistance to the disarmament. The more moderate elements of the organization can still fight for our army if they please, albeit under a vow of political neutrality. Backlash is suspected, but this is a necessary step in ensuring a loyal and unbiased army."
 CSA_2_a_new_branch:0 "A New Fleet for a New Nation"
 CSA_2_a_new_branch_desc:0 "History has shown us that navies are just as important to a nation’s security as its army. Sure, foot soldiers and tanks might prevent a frontline from moving, but cruisers and battleships will prevent potential shore bombardments, or hypothetical troop invasions from the sea. A nation with coastline without a navy would be like a bird without wings - vulnerable and easy pickings. We cannot, and will not, allow ourselves to be bled dry by having our coast cut off like in the 1860s. President West has tasked our coastal cities to begin building new ships and repurposing old ones left over from the collapse. Hopefully it will be good enough to defend ourselves until a proper fleet is built."
 CSA_2_trade_interception:0 "Prepare Raiding Flotillas"
 CSA_2_trade_interception_desc:0 "During the Civil War, the Confederates employed the use of ironclad ships to counter the mainly wooden Union navy ships that were blockading the coastlines. This has shown us that even an industrially lacking nation such as the Confederacy is able to counter a force much bigger than itself. It is clear that in our current state, a large sea fairing fleet is too ambitious, as the current state of affairs forces us to focus on more important matters. Instead, we should focus on producing smaller, more maneuverable warships like monitors and submarines so we can harass larger fleets and disrupt any vital supply lines. This fleet won’t be completely useless offensively speaking either - becoming the dominant naval power in the Gulf of Mexico is far from insignificant, and a fleet like that could help our interests in the event of Central and South American expansion."
 CSA_2_honor_hunley:0 "Honor Hunley"
 CSA_2_honor_hunley_desc:0 "The H.L. Hunley was truly a magnificent ship, being the first submarine ever to sink an enemy ship. Whilst it was sunk the same day it was used, it nonetheless showed the dangerous power of underwater warfare. Submarines today have become a frightening force in naval warfare. The Germans used them in both world wars against their enemies, and the world almost ended by the hands of a Russian submarine in the 60s. We should invest heavily into submarine production so that our above-water ships can be supported by underwater torpedoes. We will also give out the Cross of Hunley as the highest naval award a man can receive, being a true testament to how brave and courageous our sailors can be."
 CSA_2_confederate_torpedo_boats:0 "Confederate Torpedos"
 CSA_2_confederate_torpedo_boats_desc:0 "Whilst submarines are effective, above-water ships can still equip themselves with minelayers and anti-submarine torpedo launchers that could spell trouble for our fleet of submarines. We must begin research of new torpedo types so that our submarines can efficiently take down threats faster and easier before they can be destroyed themselves. We should also equip our above-water ships with these new torpedoes, as potential enemies will no doubt be using their own submarines in an attempt to counter our ships."
 CSA_2_base_strike:0 "A Tropical Fleet"
 CSA_2_base_strike_desc:0 "From our time in the Union, we have learned one simple fact - if you want to rule the seas, you have to have the biggest and best. The British knew it, and the Union sure as hell knew it. The Union navy became so powerful, it even became its' own nation after the Union collapsed! As much as we hate the Union, it’s clear that they knew what they were doing when it came to building a proper navy. Our navy has to be dominated by big ships, ships capable of traversing both oceans with ease. The naval jack of the Confederacy will be seen from Panama to the Suez in no time!"
 CSA_2_caribean_carriers:0 "Confederate Carriers"
 CSA_2_caribean_carriers_desc:0 "In the current age of naval warfare, aircraft are a much needed addition to any large and powerful fleet. A single jet fighter is just as much of a threat as a battleship is, and this cannot be left unaddressed. If we don’t have proper support for aircraft within our fleets, than the only thing keeping enemy aircraft from touching our ships are antiaircraft weapons, which can be ample targets for the very aircraft they are made to destroy. Fielding carriers will not only keep enemy aircraft busy with our own during a naval battle, but it will also allow us to have the benefits that aircraft bring to navies."
 CSA_2_caribean_dockyards:0 "Exploit Coastal Dockyards"
 CSA_2_caribean_dockyards_desc:0 "Whilst the South isn’t as industrial as the North or West, that doesn’t mean we are completely void of industry. South Carolina holds one of the largest commercial facilities on the east coast, while Alabama has an abandoned shipyard in Chickasaw just waiting to be brought back to life. Facilities just like these are sitting idle all across the Confederate coastline, and if we are to build the big navy we have envisioned, we will need as many shipyards as we can muster. President West has allowed for the refurbishment of the current coastal dockyards we have in our possession, outfitted with new technology to efficiently build and muster a fleet that will make any potential enemy think twice before attacking us."
 CSA_2_reunite_the_south:0 "A Southern Revival"
 CSA_2_reunite_the_south_desc:0 "Thanks to the efforts of President West and his administration, our nation as a whole has been reinvigorated. No longer is our identity defined by white rural nationalists or black separatists, but rather a unified culture of southern values. Support and popularity for President West is at an all-time high, groups that once plagued our streets have mostly dissipated due to the crackdowns, and the Confederate identity itself has been remade into an symbol of family and God. No longer will the proud name of the Confederacy be brought down by the horrors of slavery and white supremacy, and no longer will our forefathers be dishonored for their struggle against the Union."
 CSA_2_reclaim_the_border_state:0 "Reconvene the Convention of the People of Kentucky"
 CSA_2_reclaim_the_border_state_desc:0 "The current situation in Kentucky is worrying to say the least. Reports say that a former CEO of KFC has taken much of the state’s land over and has ruled it as a warlord ever since the collapse of the Union. Whilst we are in full support of capitalism, this corporate tyrant and his mercenary army clearly show no remorse for the population, nor do they attempt to even try to improve the lives of the citizens of Kentucky in the first place! Whilst Kentucky never joined her sisters in 1861, she still shared many similarities with the Confederate states that fought against the Union. Because of this, she was a major claim by the Confederacy during the war of Northern Aggression, and still is today. Given the reports from Kentucky, we see no better time to reclaim our rightful territory than today!"
 CSA_2_reclaim_the_single_star_state:0 "The Dallas Reclaimation"
 CSA_2_reclaim_the_single_star_state_desc:0 "Originally, Texas had proudly fought with her sister states during the war of Northern Aggression, and even helped the Confederacy by avoiding the Union naval blockade. However, when the Union finally collapsed, it seems the Texan people haven’t quite retained their sense of brotherhood with their eastern counterparts. Attempted negotiations with the current Texan government to reunify with the Confederacy have failed, and the current climate in Texas doesn’t make it seem like the citizens of Texas are too keen on rejoining our nation anytime soon. Whilst it pains us, all other options for reunification have failed, meaning there’s only one solution left for reclaiming Texas for ourselves: \n \n §RWar.§!"
 CSA_2_reclaim_the_peninsula:0 "Beeline to Miami"
 CSA_2_reclaim_the_peninsula_desc:0 "President West has never been know to be a man who holds grudges, but he has never gotten over the fact he couldn’t hold onto Florida. What’s more is the fact that Barron Trump, who isn’t even a legal adult yet, is using the state as his own fiefdom, free from the rule of his dear old dad in the north. Florida is not only important as a state that was once a part of the Confederacy in the 1860s, but also important to President West as an embarrassment to not only himself, but also an embarrassment to the people of Florida who have to endure the rule of a literal teenager. Regardless of who Barron’s father might be, he has crossed a line that President West has never forgiven him for, and our president refuses to let bygones be bygones. We will have Miami back under our control again, and this time it will STAY under our control for years to come."
 CSA_2_reclaim_the_state_of_lee:0 "Reclaim the Old Capital"
 CSA_2_reclaim_the_state_of_lee_desc:0 "Our Confederacy might share many aspects of governance and society with our 1860s counterpart, but there is one major thing missing from our Confederacy that is vital to solidifying our legitimacy: Richmond. For the majority of the war, Richmond was the capital of the Confederacy due to the city being the industrial central of the nation. Despite Virginia gaining autonomy due to the collapse, they have refused to rejoin the Confederacy, causing us to severely lag behind in our industrial sector. We mustn’t let this continue any longer, not only will we be reclaiming our historic capital, but we will also be improving our industrial output. George Patton Sr. would be proud to know that his city of Richmond is coming under the banner of the Confederacy once again!"

 CSA_2_peace_out_with_the_yankees_desc:0 "Despite having the American capital on his side, Biden has shown us that his forces are not invincible. We have managed to liberate the land him and his cronies have taken from us, and the “legitimate” forces of the US Army have fallen time and time again to our defenses. Biden might be going senile, but even he understands the importance of winning this war. If he’s unable to make progress, then people will begin to get restless, and soon the unpopularity of this war will rise to dangerous levels. If our forces are able to resist the northern armies long enough, then Biden (or a diplomat who can actually speak coherent sentences) will be forced to sue for peace, giving us the land his people stole from us and boosting our popular support."
 CSA_2_peace_out_with_the_trumpist:0 "The Alabama-Denver Accord"
 CSA_2_peace_out_with_the_trumpist_desc:0 "Despite having much of the American population rallying behind him, Trump’s forces are not infinite. Trump and his goons have been pushed out of rightful Confederate land, and we have been defending against the assaults they have sent our way. Trump may seem unreasonably bold at times, but he isn’t an idiot: he knows that if his general staff continues to see failure after failure, his support from the people will begin to dwindle, and eventually people will start to protest the current conflict. If we can hold out against Trump’s people for long enough, then we can fully press our demands for peace. They have our land, and it’s about time somebody shows the big man he isn’t invincible."

Jefferson Davis, Alexander Stephans, and Robert E. Lee must be looking down on us from heaven with tears of joy in their eyes. We have reinvigorated support for our cause, where all men’s voices are heard, and southern rights are unquestioned and unopposed! We have beaten those who have sought to exploit and put down our proud southern people, and we have shaken off the guilt that was imposed on us by the Northern carpetbaggers! Southern pride ain’t going no damn where, and President Kanye West has guaranteed that it stays for good!"

 CSA_2_Kemp_defend_the_dixie_dream_desc:0 "We have reached a crossroad in our fight for independence and self rule. There are many groups neighboring us that are eyeing our southern land like wolves eyeing a herd of sheep. Despite our successes against the various warlords and groups in the US, there are many nations to the south of us that could be potential aggressors, trying to destroy our dream of self realization and states' rights. There are currently 2 ideas floating around that could solve these issues. One idea suggests that we build up our defenses and industry so that we could provide a strict defensive against potential invaders and terrorist groups. The other idea involves us striking first against these potential invaders, forcing them to bow to our will and show that we are a force to be reckoned with in the world. Whatever road we take, we must be willing to fight for what is right, and for what God would want us to do in his name."
 CSA_2_Kemp_prepare_for_defense:0 "Prepare Defenses"
 CSA_2_Kemp_prepare_for_defense_desc:0 "President West’s entire goal was to rebuild the Confederacy and its culture from the ground up - nothing more, and nothing less. Attempting to expand beyond our heartland is a fool’s errand. We are not equipped to occupy and reintegrate foreign lands into our Confederacy nor do we wish to do such a thing. Our people’s struggle throughout history is one of defense and resistance, and we will take that mindset to the grave if we have to. We resisted the vile Northerners, and we will further resist any foreign nations and regimes who want to tear our nation to the ground. President West will propose the National Defense Act that will force the states to adhere to strict guidelines when building and maintaining defensive measures. There is suspected to be opposition to this bill, as many will see this as going against our core values of states rights, but it is a necessary evil that everybody must adhere to in order for us to survive. After all, you can’t have states’ rights if you don’t have any states left."
 CSA_2_Kemp_bunkers:0 "Build Bunkers"
 CSA_2_Kemp_bunkers_desc:0 "One of the most important strategies when it comes to defending a nation is having a strong defensive line across our border. If we have nothing to push any potential invaders out with, then defending our nation will be leagues harder than it should be. The National Defense Act will help establish a series of defensive fortifications that will help us repel any invading forces that try to take an inch of our nation. From the Rio Grande all the way up to Chesapeake Bay, our bunkers will be a telltale sign that we will not bend or break to any would-be invaders seeking to slaughter our people and ruin our way of life."
 CSA_2_Kemp_civs:0 "Increase Industrial Subsidies"
 CSA_2_Kemp_civs_desc:0 "It is no secret that the Confederacy lacks the industrial capabilities of the North. Due to our culture being a largely agricultural one, we’ve never felt the need to build large manufacturing plants for any real reason. However, the modern world has no need for societies based off of our values. Our enemies will have cities filled with factories sustaining their economies during war time whilst we would be handicapped and left high and dry in the global economy. It was the case in the 1860s, and it would definitely be the case for us if a war ever breaks out. Cotton isn’t king anymore, exported goods are. Whilst not technically a byproduct of the National Defense Act, our non-military industrial sector will be subsidized in order to increase entrepreneurial investments in our country. Foreign investments will be welcomed, but our first priority will always be the people of our nation and their needs. After all, our people don’t want to walk the streets of Richmond or Montgomery and see Chinese-owned factories everywhere they go. If they want to see the words “made in the Confederate States of America” on their products, then goddamnit we will give them just that!"
 CSA_2_Kemp_mils:0 "Increase Military Expending"
 CSA_2_Kemp_mils_desc:0 "Patriotism and spirit are one thing, but if we want to defend our lands we cannot leave our soldiers with the bare minimum we can give them. Hell, the Yankees knew better than anybody that the best army needs the best gear! And whilst our soldiers have improved in quality since the collapse, there is still room for major improvement. The National Defense Act will help us get in contact with various arms manufacturers and war dogs to help us acquire top of the line gear for our soldiers. Furthermore the Act will allow us to establish manufacturing plants and armories dedicated to providing our troops with a steady flow of supplies and guns so that we aren’t bound to the whim of foreign arms dealers. Who knows, we could even sell our guns to them for twice the retail price!"
 CSA_2_Kemp_defensive_stance:0 "Take a Defensive Stance"
 CSA_2_Kemp_defensive_stance_desc:0 "If we want to defend our nation, it is not enough to simply build bunkers and fortifications and just expect our soldiers to effectively defend against our enemies. We have to drill in a defensive mindset within our soldiers and populace. We cannot, and WILL not, allow others to push our Confederacy around like we have no guts of our own! Drill sergeants will drill in the idea that we are fighting to protect everyone and everything we love, recruitment ads will tell of the honor and duty of defending our Confederacy, and schools will even glorify our history as one of defense and resistance. Every citizen in the Confederacy will be willing to fight and die for States’ Rights and the word of the Lord our God!"
 CSA_2_our_land:0 "This is Our Land"
 CSA_2_our_land_desc:0 "There is no denying the fact that our nation is one of a kind in this giant world. Our culture, our history, and our fighting spirit is truly unique, and nobody can tell us otherwise. Groups like the Yankees and the Mexicans will bitch and moan about their “lost land”, but in truth they didn’t deserve our land in the first place! Throughout history we’ve been resisting the rule of folks who had no sympathy or relation to our culture, and finally we have been given the chance by God to rule ourselves. No matter who is president, no matter what movements happen within the states, and no matter how dissatisfied the people get of our Confederacy, this land is ours alone to rule. And we will defend these lands to our last breath if we must. To the enemies who wish to steal and rape our prosperous lands: \nNo trespassers allowed! \nTrespassers will be shot on sight!\nDeo Vindice! God is our Defender!"
 CSA_2_Kemp_golden_circle:0 "Revive Old Ambitions"
 CSA_2_Kemp_golden_circle_desc:0 "In the years preceding the war of Northern Aggression, there were a group of men who held an idea: that the South should act as a golden light to our southern neighbors, forming a circle that encompasses the Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean, spreading the glory of southern pride and life to the uncultured Spanish speakers of the Americas. Whilst the idea was never able to be put into practice due to our independence never being achieved, the second chance that has been given to us by God himself will allow us to finally enact those plan. After all, who wouldn’t want to enjoy the benefits of southern stir fry and the word of our Lord Jesus Christ?" 
 CSA_2_kemp_MEX:0 "Dibs on Mexico"
 CSA_2_kemp_MEX_desc:0 "Mexico has always been a wild and chaotic nation. They have always had changing and shifting politics, from presidents to dictators to even so called emperors. Before the collapse, Mexico had been a nation where drug cartels ran rampant and people risked their lives to try and free themselves from their unwarranted debts to the gangsters running the nation! Things have even gotten worse since the collapse, with reports coming in from the west saying how the cartels are trying to run the states like they’re still in Mexico! It’s clear that the people of Mexico are suffering under the wrath of the cartels, and if we want to create our golden circle to spread the southern lifestyle to others, then Mexico must be under our control. The Mexicans might not agree with our methods, but given the choice between us and the cartels? We think the Mexicans would much appreciate a Confederate flag flying high over Mexico City."
 CSA_2_kemp_CUB:0 "The Caribbean Confederates"
 CSA_2_kemp_CUB_desc:0 "The Caribbean in recent years have been a political mess. The recent UN intervention in Puerto Rico, a rouge admiral seizing the Florida Keys, and the dirty communists in Cuba have shown us that the region is far from stable. However, that doesn’t mean we cannot make it such, as our plans for the golden circle include the numerous islands of the Caribbean. Not only would we be spreading southern pride and values to the downtrodden people of Cuba and Hispaniola, but it would also allow us to have naval bases and dockyards to help expand our fleet. We will begin to draft plans for Operation Caribbean Freedom, which will encompass naval invasions across the entirety of the Caribbean Sea. Many on the islands would call the operation “imperialism”, but the way we see it, we’re simply extending out a beneficial hand to the impoverished people of the Caribbean!"
 CSA_2_kemp_HON:0 "The Central American Confederacy"
 CSA_2_kemp_HON_desc:0 "In the 1820s, an entity known as the Federal Republic of Central America formed, spanning from Guatemala to Costa Rica. However, barely 20 years after it formed it dissolved, literally tearing itself apart due to infighting and political instability. This has allowed us to make one single conclusion in history, that a federal system of governance is doomed to fail to begin with! The Union couldn’t hold itself together, and the Federal Republic of Central America was no different. However, from the broken pieces of federal America, our Confederacy emerged, and we have proven ourselves to be more stable and competent than the bickering states that follow so called “federalism”. Despite being within the realm our ideal golden circle, we feel as though we have an obligation to the people of Central America to correct the mistakes of the old federal government and show them just how great the Confederate system can truly be!"
 CSA_2_kemp_COL:0 "The Dream of Bolivar"
 CSA_2_kemp_COL_desc:0 "There was once an idea present on the northern tip of South America: a nation that encompassed the nations of Venezuela, Colombia and Ecuador. They called it Gran Colombia, led by a mighty man calling himself Bolivar. However, the dream did not last, as regional differences between the 3 nations was too much to bear on the young nation. This has shown us that the dream of brotherly love between states was never exclusive to our Confederacy, and it even reaffirms our claims that federalism is a failed concept, leaving nothing but disunited and bickering nations in its wake. Not only this, but the cartels and pirates we have been cracking down on since taking Mexico and the Caribbean have fled to both Colombia and Venezuela, bringing their scum and villainy to the two nations. We can use this excuse to justify peacekeeping missions in the region, and finalize our dream of a golden circle that shines southern pride on all it touches. \nOh, and the oil. LOTS of oil!"

 decaying_industry_idea_desc:0 "The American Free State lies in a region of the former country known as the '§YRust Belt§!.' Formerly an industrial powerhouse, the Great Lakes region has seen the amount of manufacturing jobs plummet since the 1950s with little hope of ever bringing them back. Entrepreneurs are hesitant to open new factories, and any new drive to do so would require extra government incentive along with a slowed-down schedule."
 triumvirate_idea:0 "The Triumvirate"
 triumvirate_idea_desc:0 "The three-headed leadership structure that rules the American Free State, known as '§Ythe Triumvirate§!,' successfully navigated the Chaos of the First Months; securing for themselves and their followers a large portion of land in the American midwest following a revolt from Jo Jorgensen's GLAR. Vermin Supreme, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, and James Mattis reject Jorgensen's right-libertarianism, refuse to collaborate with Trump (who they blame for starting this whole mess), and view the old Democratic party of Joe Biden as ineffective and weak. Unfortunately for the people of the AFS, this is about where their commonalities end. As the ceasefire settles in and these three need to work together towards policy to actually build up what they have, cracks begin to show.\nOne can be absolutlely certain on one aspect of their relationship though:\n§Rif one falls, the whole structure collapses§!."
